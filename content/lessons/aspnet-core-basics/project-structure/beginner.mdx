# Project Structure

When you create a new ASP.NET Core project, you get a ready-made folder structure. Think of it like moving into a new apartment that already has rooms set up - you just need to know which room is for what!

## Section 1: Project Basics

### Your Project is Like a Well-Organized Kitchen

Imagine your project as a professional kitchen:

- **The Recipe Book** (`Program.cs`) - The main instructions for how everything runs
- **The Pantry** (`appsettings.json`) - Where you store ingredients (settings)
- **The Prep Stations** (`Controllers/` folder) - Where specific work happens
- **The Storage Room** (`Properties/`) - Behind-the-scenes organization

### The Most Important Files

When you're just starting, focus on these files:

| File | What It Does | Analogy |
|:-----|:-------------|:--------|
| `Program.cs` | Starts your app | The head chef |
| `appsettings.json` | Stores settings | The recipe book |
| `.csproj` | Lists dependencies | The shopping list |

### Don't Worry About Everything!

When starting out, you don't need to understand every file. Focus on:

1. `Program.cs` - Where you'll add features
2. `appsettings.json` - Where you'll change settings
3. ⏳ Other files - Learn these as you need them

## Section 2: Project Structure Overview

### What's in a New Project?

When you create a project with `dotnet new webapi`, you get:

```
MyWebApi/
├── Controllers/          ← Your API endpoints
├── Properties/           ← Launch settings
├── appsettings.json      ← Configuration
├── Program.cs            ← App entry point
└── MyWebApi.csproj       ← Project file
```

### Understanding Each Part

**Program.cs** - Where your app starts:
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddControllers();

var app = builder.Build();
app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

**appsettings.json** - Your settings:
```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

**Controllers/** - Where you handle requests:
```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class HelloController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public string Get() => "Hello World!";
}
```

### Common Folders You'll Add

As your project grows, you'll add these folders:

| Folder | What Goes There |
|:-------|:----------------|
| `Models/` | Data classes |
| `Services/` | Business logic |
| `Data/` | Database stuff |

## Section 3: Project Files Explained

### The .csproj File

This XML file tells .NET about your project:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

**Key parts:**
- `Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web"` - This is a web project
- `TargetFramework` - Which .NET version to use

### Adding Packages

When you need extra features, add packages:

```bash
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
```

This adds to your .csproj:
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.3" />
</ItemGroup>
```

### launchSettings.json

Controls how your app runs during development:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "http": {
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000"
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Takeaways

<InfoBox type="tip">
**Remember:**
- `Program.cs` is where your app starts
- `appsettings.json` stores configuration
- `.csproj` lists your dependencies
- Create folders like `Models/`, `Services/` as needed
