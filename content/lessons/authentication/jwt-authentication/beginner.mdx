# JWT Authentication

Let's learn about one of the most popular ways to secure APIs! 

## What is a JWT?

Think of a **JWT (JSON Web Token)** like a **concert ticket**:

 Your ticket has:
- **Your name** (who you are)
- **Seat number** (what you can access)
- **Event details** (who issued it)
- **Security hologram** (proof it&apos;s real)

A JWT works the same way — it&apos;s a digital ticket that proves who you are!

## The Three Parts

Every JWT has **three parts** separated by dots:

```
eyJhbGciOi...   .   eyJzdWIiOi...   .   SflKxwRJ...
    HEADER            PAYLOAD           SIGNATURE
    (red)            (purple)            (blue)
```

| Part | What It Contains | Plain English |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Header** | Algorithm info | "I used HS256 to sign this" |
| **Payload** | User data (claims) | "You are John, an Admin" |
| **Signature** | Security hash | "This proves I made it" |

<InfoBox type="tip">
  The payload is NOT encrypted! It&apos;s just Base64 encoded. Never put passwords or secrets in a JWT.
</InfoBox>

## Why Use JWT?

### Stateless Authentication

| Cookie-Based  | JWT-Based  |
|----------------|--------------|
| Server stores sessions | Token contains everything |
| Requires session database | No server storage needed |
| Hard to scale | Easy to scale |
| Works for websites | Perfect for APIs |

<InfoBox type="note">
  JWTs are **self-contained** — the token itself holds all the info the server needs to verify you!
</InfoBox>

## How It Works (The Simple Version)

1. **Login** 
   - You send username + password
   - Server verifies them
   - Server creates a JWT with your info
   - Server sends JWT back to you

2. **Use the Token** 
   - You include JWT in every request
   - Server reads and verifies the JWT
   - No database lookup needed!

3. **Token Expires** ⏰
   - JWTs have an expiration time
   - Get a new one by refreshing or logging in again

## The Simple Flow

```csharp
// Step 1: Login - You get a token
POST /api/auth/login
{ "email": "john@example.com", "password": "secret123" }

// Response: Here's your JWT!
{ "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..." }

// Step 2: Call protected API with token
GET /api/protected/data
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...

// Server says: "I see your valid ticket! Here's your data."
```

## Key Takeaways

-  **JWT = Digital concert ticket** with your identity baked in
-  **Three parts**: Header (algorithm), Payload (your data), Signature (proof)
-  **NOT encrypted** — anyone can read the payload, so no secrets!
-  **Stateless** — server doesn&apos;t need to store sessions
- ⏰ **Self-expiring** — tokens become invalid after set time
