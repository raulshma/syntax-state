# SQL Fundamentals

Welcome to the world of databases! SQL (Structured Query Language) is the universal language for talking to databases. Let's learn how to speak it!

## Section 1: Introduction to SQL

### ️ What is SQL?

Imagine you have a giant filing cabinet with thousands of folders. SQL is like having a super-smart assistant who can:

- **Find** any document you describe
- **Add** new documents
- **Update** existing documents
- **Remove** documents you don't need

> **Think of it this way:** SQL is like ordering at a restaurant. You tell the database what you want, and it brings it to you!

### The Four Magic Words: CRUD

Every database operation falls into four categories, known as **CRUD**:

| Operation | SQL Command | What It Does | Restaurant Analogy |
|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------------|
| **C**reate | INSERT | Adds new data | Ordering new food |
| **R**ead | SELECT | Retrieves data | Looking at the menu |
| **U**pdate | UPDATE | Changes existing data | Modifying your order |
| **D**elete | DELETE | Removes data | Canceling an order |

## Section 2: SELECT Queries

### SELECT - Reading Data 

SELECT is the most common SQL command. It's how you ask questions about your data.

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Your First SELECT Query"
  code={`-- Get everything from the Users table
SELECT * FROM Users;

-- Get only names and emails
SELECT Name, Email FROM Users;`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [2],
      highlight: "The asterisk (*)",
      explanation: "The * means 'give me ALL columns' - it's like saying 'show me everything!'"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [5],
      highlight: "Specific columns",
      explanation: "You can also ask for just the columns you need - like ordering only the items you want"
    }
  ]}
/>

### Selecting Multiple Columns

```sql
-- Get three specific columns
SELECT Name, Email, Age FROM Users;

-- You can rename columns with AS
SELECT Name AS FullName, Email AS EmailAddress FROM Users;
```

<InfoBox type="tip">
  **Pro Tip:** Only select the columns you need! It makes your queries faster and uses less memory.
</InfoBox>

## Section 3: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

### INSERT - Adding Data 

INSERT adds new records to your table - like putting a new card in a filing cabinet.

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Adding a New User"
  code={`INSERT INTO Users (Name, Email, Age)
VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@email.com', 28);`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [1],
      highlight: "Table and columns",
      explanation: "Tell the database which table and which columns you're filling"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [2],
      highlight: "The values",
      explanation: "Provide the actual data - make sure the order matches the columns!"
    }
  ]}
/>

### UPDATE - Changing Data ️

UPDATE modifies existing records. Be careful - you can change many records at once!

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Updating a User's Email"
  code={`UPDATE Users
SET Email = 'alice.new@email.com'
WHERE Name = 'Alice';`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [1],
      highlight: "Which table",
      explanation: "Specify the table you want to update"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [2],
      highlight: "What to change",
      explanation: "SET tells the database what new value(s) to use"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [3],
      highlight: "WHERE is crucial!",
      explanation: "Without WHERE, you'd update EVERY row! Always double-check your WHERE clause"
    }
  ]}
/>

### DELETE - Removing Data ️

DELETE permanently removes records. Once gone, they're gone forever (without backups)!

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Deleting a User"
  code={`-- Delete a specific user
DELETE FROM Users
WHERE Name = 'Alice';

-- DANGER! This deletes EVERYONE!
-- DELETE FROM Users;`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [3],
      highlight: "WHERE saves you",
      explanation: "The WHERE clause ensures you only delete what you intend to delete"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [6],
      highlight: "Never do this!",
      explanation: "Without WHERE, you'd delete ALL data in the table - always use WHERE with DELETE"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Section 4: WHERE Clauses

###  WHERE - Filtering Your Data

The WHERE clause is like a filter - it lets you specify exactly which rows you want to work with.

```sql
-- Find users over 25
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age > 25;

-- Find users named 'Bob'
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = 'Bob';

-- Combine conditions with AND
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age > 25 AND Active = 1;

-- Use OR for alternatives
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age < 18 OR Age > 65;
```

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|:---------|:--------|:--------|
| `=` | Equal to | `WHERE Age = 25` |
| `!=` or `<>` | Not equal | `WHERE Status != 'Inactive'` |
| `>` | Greater than | `WHERE Age > 18` |
| `<` | Less than | `WHERE Price < 100` |
| `>=` | Greater or equal | `WHERE Score >= 90` |
| `<=` | Less or equal | `WHERE Stock <= 10` |

### Special WHERE Operators

```sql
-- LIKE for pattern matching
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email LIKE '%@gmail.com';

-- IN for multiple values
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age IN (18, 21, 25, 30);

-- BETWEEN for ranges
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 50;

-- IS NULL for missing values
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Phone IS NULL;
```

## Quick Summary

| Command | Purpose | Always Include? |
|:--------|:--------|:----------------|
| SELECT | Read data | Usually with WHERE |
| INSERT | Add new data | Column values |
| UPDATE | Change data | **Always use WHERE!** |
| DELETE | Remove data | **Always use WHERE!** |
| WHERE | Filter rows | With UPDATE/DELETE |
