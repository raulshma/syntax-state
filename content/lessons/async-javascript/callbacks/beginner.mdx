# Callbacks: "Call Me Back!"

Imagine you're at a busy coffee shop. You order your latte, but instead of waiting at the counter, the barista says:

> "I'll **call you** when your drink is ready!"

That's exactly what a **callback** is in JavaScript - a function you provide that will be "called back" when something finishes.

## What is a Callback?

A callback is simply a function that you pass to another function. It gets executed later, when a task completes.

```javascript
// You're telling the button: "When someone clicks, call this function!"
button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  alert("You clicked me!");
});
```

## Real-Life Analogy

Think about ordering food online:

1. 🛒 You place your order (start the task)
2. 📱 You give them your phone number (the callback)
3. ⏳ You go do other things (JavaScript keeps running)
4. 📞 They call you when food arrives (callback is invoked!)

Without callbacks, you'd have to stand at the door waiting!

## Common Callbacks in Action

| Scenario       | What Happens                |
| :------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Click a button | Callback runs when clicked  |
| Page loads     | Callback runs when ready    |
| Timer finishes | Callback runs after delay   |
| Data arrives   | Callback runs with the data |

## A Simple Example

```javascript
// Set a reminder for 3 seconds
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Time is up!");
}, 3000);

console.log("Timer started...");
// Output: "Timer started..." (immediately)
// Then after 3 seconds: "Time's up!"
```

The magic? JavaScript didn't wait! It kept running while the timer counted down.
