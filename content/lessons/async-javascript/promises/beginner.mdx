# Promises: A Receipt for the Future

Imagine you order food at a restaurant. The waiter gives you a **receipt** - a promise that your food will arrive. That receipt can have three states:

1. **Pending** ⏳ - Still cooking
2. **Fulfilled**  - Food is ready!
3. **Rejected**  - Kitchen is out of ingredients

A JavaScript **Promise** works exactly the same way!

## The Food Order Analogy

```javascript
// You place an order (make a promise)
const myOrder = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // The kitchen is working...
  setTimeout(() => {
    const success = true;

    if (success) {
      resolve("🍕 Pizza is ready!"); // Fulfilled!
    } else {
      reject("😢 Out of pizza dough"); // Rejected!
    }
  }, 2000);
});
```

## Getting Your Order

Just like waiting for your food, you use `.then()` to handle the result:

```javascript
myOrder
  .then((food) => {
    console.log("Yay!", food); // "Yay! 🍕 Pizza is ready!"
  })
  .catch((problem) => {
    console.log("Oh no!", problem); // Handle the rejection
  });
```

## Why Promises Are Better Than Callbacks

| Callbacks                 | Promises               |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------- |
| Nested pyramid          | Flat chain ️          |
| Error handling everywhere | One `.catch()` for all |
| Hard to read              | Reads like a story     |

## Promise States

| State         | Meaning              | Example                  |
| :------------ | :------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **Pending**   | Waiting for result   | Order placed, waiting... |
| **Fulfilled** | Success!             | Food delivered!        |
| **Rejected**  | Something went wrong | Order cancelled        |

> Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, it's **settled** and can never change!

## A Simple Real Example

```javascript
// Fetching data from the internet
fetch("https://api.example.com/user")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((user) => console.log("Hello,", user.name))
  .catch((error) => console.log("Failed to load user"));
```

Promises make async code readable and manageable!
