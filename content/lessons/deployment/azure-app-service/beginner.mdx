# Azure App Service

Imagine looking for a place to live. You could **build a house from scratch** (managing your own servers), or you could **rent a fully furnished apartment** where someone else handles maintenance, security, and utilities.

**Azure App Service is that fully furnished apartment for your .NET apps!**

## What is Azure App Service?

Azure App Service is a **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)** that hosts your web apps without you worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

## Why Choose App Service?

Think about what happens when you manage your own server:

| You Handle (Self-Hosted) | Azure Handles (App Service) |
|:------------------------|:---------------------------|
|  Operating system updates |  Automatic patching |
|  Security configuration |  Built-in SSL/TLS |
|  Load balancing setup |  Automatic load balancing |
|  Scaling decisions |  Auto-scale rules |
|  Hardware failures |  High availability |

You just bring your code, Azure does the rest!

## The Deployment Journey

  code={`# Step 1: Login to Azure
az login

# Step 2: Create a resource group
az group create --name myapp-rg --location eastus

# Step 3: Create an App Service plan
az appservice plan create \\
    --name myapp-plan \\
    --resource-group myapp-rg \\
    --sku B1

# Step 4: Create the web app
az webapp create \\
    --name my-dotnet-app \\
    --resource-group myapp-rg \\
    --plan myapp-plan \\
    --runtime "DOTNETCORE:8.0"

# Step 5: Deploy your code
az webapp deploy \\
    --name my-dotnet-app \\
    --resource-group myapp-rg \\
    --src-path ./publish.zip`}

## Understanding App Service Plans

App Service Plans are like apartment tiers:

| Tier | Analogy | Best For |
|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| **Free/Shared** | Hostel bunk bed | Testing, learning |
| **Basic** | Studio apartment | Dev/test, low traffic |
| **Standard** | 2-bedroom apartment | Production, most apps |
| **Premium** | Luxury penthouse | High-traffic, enterprise |

<KeyConcept 
  title="App Service Plan = Your Resource Pool"
  description="Multiple apps can share the same plan (like roommates sharing an apartment). The plan determines how much CPU, memory, and features you get."
/>

## Quick Wins with App Service

1. **Free SSL certificates** - HTTPS enabled by default
2. **Custom domains** - Use your own domain name
3. **Continuous deployment** - Connect to GitHub for automatic deploys
4. **Built-in authentication** - Add login with Microsoft, Google, etc.
5. **Application insights** - Monitoring out of the box

## Summary

| Concept | Analogy |
|:--------|:--------|
| **App Service** | Managed apartment for your app |
| **App Service Plan** | The apartment building (determines size/price) |
| **Resource Group** | Neighborhood where all your Azure stuff lives |
| **Web App** | Your actual application running in the apartment |
