# Docker for .NET

Imagine you're moving to a new house. Instead of hoping all your furniture fits in random boxes and prays nothing breaks, you rent a **standardized shipping container**. Everything fits perfectly, it's protected during transport, and it works the same whether it goes by truck, ship, or train.

**Docker does exactly this for your .NET apps!**

## What is Docker?

Docker is like a magic box that packages your entire application - code, runtime, libraries, settings - into a neat, portable container.

## Why Use Docker for .NET?

Think about these common developer headaches:

| Problem | Docker Solution |
|:--------|:---------------|
| "It works on my machine!" |  Same container = same behavior everywhere |
| Complex setup instructions |  One command: `docker run` |
| Dependency conflicts |  Each app has its own isolated world |
| Slow deployments |  Deploy containers in seconds |

## The Dockerfile - Your Recipe

A Dockerfile is like a recipe for baking your app into a container. Let's look at the simplest version:

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Simple Dockerfile"
  code={`# Start with a base image that has .NET
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0

# Copy your published app
COPY ./publish /app

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Tell Docker how to start your app
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyApp.dll"]`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [2],
      highlight: "Base Image",
      explanation: "This is like starting with a pre-made pizza base. Microsoft provides ready-to-use .NET images!"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [5],
      highlight: "Copy Your App",
      explanation: "Copy your already-built app into the container"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [11],
      highlight: "Start Command",
      explanation: "Tell Docker exactly how to run your app"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Key Concepts to Remember

> **Image** = The recipe/blueprint (like a class)  
> **Container** = A running instance (like an object)  
> **Dockerfile** = Instructions to build the image

## Quick Summary

| Concept | Real-World Analogy |
|:--------|:------------------|
| **Docker Image** | Recipe or blueprint |
| **Container** | Actual running app |
| **Dockerfile** | Cooking instructions |
| **Registry** | Recipe book store (like Docker Hub) |
