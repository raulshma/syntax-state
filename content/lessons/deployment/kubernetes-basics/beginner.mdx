# Kubernetes Basics

Imagine you're directing a massive **orchestra performance**. You have dozens of musicians, each playing different instruments. Your job is to make sure everyone starts on time, plays in harmony, and if someone gets tired, you bring in a replacement without the audience ever noticing.

**Kubernetes is the conductor for your containers!**

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an **orchestration platform** that manages your containerized applications. It handles:

- Starting and stopping containers
- Distributing traffic between containers
- Replacing crashed containers automatically
- Scaling up or down based on demand

## The Orchestra Analogy

| Orchestra Term | Kubernetes Term | Purpose |
|:--------------|:----------------|:--------|
| Musician | **Pod** | Runs your actual app |
| Music Stand | **ConfigMap** | Configuration for the musician |
| Sheet Music | **Container Image** | What to play (your code) |
| Section (violins, cellos) | **Deployment** | A group of identical musicians |
| Concert Hall Entrance | **Service** | How audience finds musicians |
| Conductor | **Kubernetes** | Coordinates everything |

## Core Concepts Simplified

### Pod 
The smallest unit - a single "musician" playing your app:

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="What is a Pod?"
  code={`# A Pod is like a wrapper for your container
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-dotnet-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: myapp:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [3],
      highlight: "Kind: Pod",
      explanation: "This tells Kubernetes we want to create a Pod"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [8, 9],
      highlight: "Container Image",
      explanation: "The Docker image to run - your .NET app!"
    }
  ]}
/>

### Deployment 
A group of identical pods - like having 5 violin players:

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="What is a Deployment?"
  code={`apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-dotnet-app
spec:
  replicas: 3  # We want 3 copies!
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-dotnet-app
  template:
    # Pod template goes here
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:latest`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [6],
      highlight: "Replicas",
      explanation: "Kubernetes ensures exactly 3 pods are always running"
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [7, 8, 9],
      highlight: "Selector",
      explanation: "Labels help Kubernetes track which pods belong to this deployment"
    }
  ]}
/>

### Service 
The entry point - how traffic finds your pods:

```
Internet → Service → [Pod 1, Pod 2, Pod 3]
                         ↓
                   (Load balanced!)
```

## Why Kubernetes?

> Without K8s: "Pod crashed at 3 AM... your app is DOWN!"
> 
> With K8s: "Pod crashed at 3 AM, K8s automatically replaced it. Users never noticed!"

<KeyConcept 
  title="Self-Healing"
  description="Kubernetes constantly watches your pods. If one crashes or becomes unhealthy, K8s automatically creates a replacement - no human intervention needed!"
/>

## Quick Summary

| Concept | What It Does | Real-World Analogy |
|:--------|:------------|:-------------------|
| **Pod** | Runs your container | A single musician |
| **Deployment** | Manages replica pods | A section of the orchestra |
| **Service** | Routes traffic to pods | Concert hall entrance |
| **Cluster** | Group of machines running K8s | The entire concert hall |
