## Shared Hosting Deep Dive

**Shared hosting** is where multiple websites share the same server resources — CPU, RAM, and storage.

### How It Works

    columns 1
    block:server["fa:fa-server Physical Server"]:1
        columns 4
        A["fa:fa-globe Site A<br />(You)"]
        B["fa:fa-globe Site B"]
        C["fa:fa-globe Site C"]
        D["fa:fa-globe Site D"]
    end
```

> All sites share the same CPU, RAM, and storage resources

### Pros
- **Cost-effective**: $3-15/month
- **Managed**: Provider handles server maintenance
- **Easy setup**: One-click installs for WordPress, etc.

### Cons
- **Resource limits**: Other sites can slow you down
- **Security risks**: Vulnerabilities in neighboring sites
- **Limited control**: Can't install custom software

Perfect for personal blogs, portfolio sites, small business websites, and any site expecting less than 10,000 monthly visitors.

## VPS (Virtual Private Server)

A **VPS** uses virtualization to give you dedicated resources on a shared physical machine.

### How It Works

```mermaid

    subgraph Server["fa:fa-server Physical Server"]
        subgraph VS1["Virtual Server 1"]
            Y["fa:fa-globe Your Site<br />2GB RAM | 2 CPU"]
        end
        subgraph VS2["Virtual Server 2"]
            O["fa:fa-globe Other Site<br />4GB RAM | 4 CPU"]
        end
    end
```

> Each VPS has guaranteed, isolated resources

### Key Differences from Shared
- **Guaranteed resources**: Your 2GB RAM is always yours
- **Root access**: Install any software you need
- **Isolation**: Other sites can't affect your performance

<Comparison

  right={{ title: "VPS Hosting", items: ["Dedicated resources", "Full root access", "You manage your server", "$20-100/month"] }}
/>

## Dedicated Servers

A **dedicated server** means you rent an entire physical machine exclusively for your use.

### When You Need Dedicated
- High-traffic websites (100,000+ monthly visitors)
- Resource-intensive applications
- Strict compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- Maximum security needs

### Considerations
- **Cost**: $100-500+/month
- **Expertise**: You need sysadmin skills or hire someone
- **Responsibility**: Hardware failures are your problem

## Cloud Hosting

**Cloud hosting** distributes your website across multiple connected servers.

### Key Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Add resources instantly during traffic spikes
2. **Reliability**: If one server fails, others take over
3. **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for what you use

### Popular Cloud Providers
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Most comprehensive
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Great for data/ML
- **Microsoft Azure**: Enterprise-focused
- **DigitalOcean/Linode**: Developer-friendly, simpler

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Cloud Cost Warning">
Cloud hosting can get expensive quickly! A misconfigured service or traffic spike can result in unexpected bills. Always set up billing alerts and spending limits.
