# What is a Domain Name?

Now that we know what domain names are, let's look at how the internet actually figures out where they live. This process is called **DNS Resolution**.

## The Domain Name System (DNS)

The DNS is often called the "phonebook of the internet", but it's much more than a static list. It's a distributed database. No single computer has all the records.

Instead, the information is spread across thousands of servers worldwide, organized in a hierarchy.

<KeyConcept title="Distributed System" icon="server">
  - **Root Servers**: The top of the hierarchy. They know where the TLD servers
  are. - **TLD Servers**: They manage specific endings like `.com` or `.org`. -
  **Authoritative Nameservers**: These hold the actual records for specific
  domains like `google.com`.
</KeyConcept>

## How Resolution Works

When you type a URL, your computer doesn't know the IP address. It has to ask for help. This is called a **Recursive Query**.

1. Your computer asks a **Recursive Resolver** (usually provided by your ISP).
2. The Resolver does the hard work of hunting down the answer.

Watch the journey of a DNS request below:

Notice how the resolver hops from one server to another until it finds the answer? This entire process usually takes less than a few milliseconds!

## Registrars vs Registries

You might own a domain name, but you don't really "own" it forever. You are leasing it.

- **Registry**: The organization that manages the TLD (e.g., Verisign manages .com).
- **Registrar**: The company you pay money to (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap). They are the middleman between you and the Registry.

    "The Root Server",
    "The TLD Server (.com)",
    "The Authoritative NameServer",
    "Your Computer",

  explanation="The Authoritative NameServer is the final authority. It holds the specific records for the domain and provides the actual IP address."
