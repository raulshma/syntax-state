# What is a Domain Name?

At an advanced level, Domain Names are defined by **Resource Records**. These records are what actually control the behavior of the domain.

## DNS Records

A domain name isn't just a single pointer. It can point to many things at once: a web server, a mail server, a verification key, and more.

Explore the different types of records below to see what they do:

## The Zone File

All these records for a single domain are stored in a text file called a **Zone File** on the Authoritative Nameserver.

Here is what a simple Zone File looks like:

```dns
$ORIGIN example.com.
$TTL 3600
@       IN  SOA     ns1.example.com. hostmaster.example.com. (
                        2023102401 ; serial
                        7200       ; refresh
                        3600       ; retry
                        1209600    ; expire
                        86400 )    ; minimum
        IN  NS      ns1.example.com.
        IN  NS      ns2.example.com.
@       IN  A       93.184.216.34
www     IN  CNAME   @
mail    IN  MX  10  mail.example.com.
```

## Recursive vs Iterative Queries

When we say "DNS Resolution", there are actually two ways to ask a question:

<Comparison
  leftTitle="Recursive Query"
  rightTitle="Iterative Query"
  leftContent="The client says: 'Find the answer for me'. The server takes full responsibility and won't return until it has the final answer (or an error)."
  rightContent="The client says: 'Tell me who to ask next'. The server replies with the best referral it has (e.g., 'I don't know, but here is the .com server')."
/>

Your computer typically sends a **Recursive** query to your ISP's resolver. The ISP's resolver then sends **Iterative** queries to the Root, TLD, and Authoritative servers.

<CodeExample
  language="bash"
  code="dig +trace example.com"
  title="Trace a DNS Query"
/>

The `dig` command above forces your computer to perform the iterative queries itself, showing you every hop in the chain!

<Quiz
  question="Why might you use a CNAME record instead of an A record?"
  options={[
    "It is faster to resolve",
    "To alias one name to another (like www to root) so IP changes only need to happen in one place",
    "It provides better security",
    "It allows for multiple IP addresses",
  ]}
  correctAnswer={1}
  explanation="CNAMEs are aliases. If you point 'www' to 'example.com', and then change the IP of 'example.com', 'www' updates automatically."
