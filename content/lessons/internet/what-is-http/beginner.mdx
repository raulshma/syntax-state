# What is HTTP?

Imagine you are at a restaurant. You (the client) look at the menu and tell the waiter (the request) what you want. The waiter goes to the kitchen (the server), gets your food, and brings it back to you (the response).

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is like that waiter. It's the set of rules for how messages are sent back and forth on the web.

## The Conversation

When you type a URL into your browser, you are starting a conversation:

1.  **Request**: "Hey server, please send me the landing page."
2.  **Response**: "Sure! Here is the HTML code."

This simple back-and-forth is happening hundreds of times every time you browse the web!
