# Understanding HTTP Requests

At a deeper level, HTTP is not just a casual conversation. It's a structured exchange of data. Every message has a **format** that both the browser and server understand.

## The Request Structure

A request consists of:

- **Method**: What do you want to do? (GET, POST, etc.)
- **Path**: What resource do you want? (`/home`, `/image.png`)
- **Headers**: Extra info (like what language you speak).

### Try it yourself!

Build a request below and see what it looks like.

## Common Methods

| Method     | Description                         |
| :--------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **GET**    | Retrieve data (like loading a page) |
| **POST**   | Send data (like submitting a form)  |
| **PUT**    | Update data                         |
| **DELETE** | Remove data                         |
