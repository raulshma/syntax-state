# HTTP Under the Hood

HTTP has evolved significantly over the years. What started as simple text transfer has become a highly optimized binary protocol.

## Protocol Versions

### HTTP/1.1

The classic version. It's text-based and readable by humans, but it has performance issues like "Head-of-Line Blocking" (one slow request slows down everything).

### HTTP/2

Introduced **Binary Framing**. Instead of text, data is chopped into binary chunks. This allows **Multiplexing**—sending multiple files at once over the same connection!

### HTTPS (Secure)

HTTP is sent in "clear text", meaning anyone can read it. **HTTPS** wraps HTTP in a secure **TLS** (Transport Layer Security) tunnel.
