# Webpack: The Swiss Army Knife of Bundlers 

Welcome to Webpack! It's been around since 2012 and remains one of the most powerful and configurable bundlers in the JavaScript ecosystem.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="The Professional Kitchen Analogy">
If Vite is a food truck and esbuild is a race car, Webpack is a fully-equipped professional kitchen. It has every appliance imaginable - from basic ovens to molecular gastronomy equipment. It takes longer to learn and set up, but once configured, it can handle any recipe you throw at it.

## Why Learn Webpack?

Even with newer tools available, Webpack remains important:

- **Legacy projects** - Many existing projects use Webpack
- **Maximum flexibility** - Can handle any build requirement
- **Huge ecosystem** - Thousands of loaders and plugins
- **Enterprise adoption** - Standard in many companies

<KeyConcept title="Webpack's Philosophy">
Webpack treats everything as a module - JavaScript, CSS, images, fonts, even HTML. It builds a dependency graph of your entire application and bundles everything into optimized output files.
</KeyConcept>

<ProgressCheckpoint section="core-concepts" xpReward={10} />

## The Five Core Concepts

Webpack has five fundamental concepts you need to understand:

### 1. Entry
Where Webpack starts building the dependency graph.

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  // Webpack starts here and follows all imports
}
```

### 2. Output
Where Webpack puts the bundled files.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: '/dist',
  },
}
```

### 3. Loaders
Transform files before they're added to the bundle.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.css$/, use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'] },
    ],
  },
}
```

### 4. Plugins
Perform wider tasks like optimization and asset management.

```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: './src/index.html' }),
  ],
}
```

### 5. Mode
Tells Webpack which optimizations to use.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  mode: 'development', // or 'production'
}
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install Webpack and CLI
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

### Basic Configuration

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  
  // Entry point
  entry: './src/index.js',
  
  // Output configuration
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    clean: true, // Clean dist folder before each build
  },
}
```

### Running Webpack

```bash
# Build once
npx webpack

# Watch mode
npx webpack --watch

# Production build
npx webpack --mode production
```

### Package.json Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack",
    "build:prod": "webpack --mode production",
    "watch": "webpack --watch"
  }
}
```

## Understanding Loaders

Loaders transform files. They work from right to left (or bottom to top):

```javascript
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,           // Match .css files
        use: [
          'style-loader',         // 3. Inject CSS into DOM
          'css-loader',           // 2. Resolve @import and url()
          // If you had sass-loader, it would be here (1. Compile SCSS)
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

<InfoBox type="analogy" title="Loaders are Like Assembly Line Workers">
Imagine an assembly line where each worker does one specific task. The CSS file enters, the first worker (css-loader) processes imports, then passes it to the next worker (style-loader) who injects it into the page. Each loader does one thing well!
</InfoBox>

### Common Loaders

| Loader | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `babel-loader` | Transpile modern JS |
| `css-loader` | Process CSS imports |
| `style-loader` | Inject CSS into DOM |
| `file-loader` | Handle files (images, fonts) |
| `ts-loader` | Compile TypeScript |

<ProgressCheckpoint section="plugins" xpReward={10} />

## Understanding Plugins

Plugins are more powerful than loaders - they can modify the entire build process:

```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // Generate HTML file with script tags
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/index.html',
      title: 'My App',
    }),
    
    // Extract CSS into separate files
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: 'styles.css',
    }),
  ],
}
```

### Common Plugins

| Plugin | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `HtmlWebpackPlugin` | Generate HTML files |
| `MiniCssExtractPlugin` | Extract CSS to files |
| `DefinePlugin` | Define global constants |
| `CopyWebpackPlugin` | Copy static files |

## Development Server

Webpack Dev Server provides live reloading:

```bash
npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
```

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    static: './dist',
    port: 3000,
    open: true,        // Open browser automatically
    hot: true,         // Hot Module Replacement
  },
}
```

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack serve"
  }
}
```
