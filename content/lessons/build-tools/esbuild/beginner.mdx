# esbuild: The Speed Champion 

Welcome to esbuild! If you've ever waited for your build to finish, esbuild is about to blow your mind with its incredible speed.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="The Race Car Analogy">
If traditional bundlers are like fully-loaded SUVs with every feature imaginable, esbuild is a Formula 1 race car - stripped down, purpose-built for one thing: SPEED. It does fewer things, but does them incredibly fast.
</InfoBox>

## Why esbuild is So Fast

esbuild is 10-100x faster than traditional bundlers. Here's why:

### 1. Written in Go, Not JavaScript

```
JavaScript Bundler:
🐢 Single-threaded → Process files one by one → Slow

esbuild (Go):
🚀 Multi-threaded → Process files in parallel → FAST!
```

<KeyConcept title="The Language Advantage">
JavaScript runs in a single thread and has garbage collection pauses. Go compiles to native machine code, uses all CPU cores simultaneously, and has minimal runtime overhead. This architectural difference makes esbuild fundamentally faster.
</KeyConcept>

### 2. Everything in One Pass

```
Traditional Bundler:
Pass 1: Parse → Pass 2: Transform → Pass 3: Bundle → Pass 4: Minify
(Each pass reads and writes the entire codebase)

esbuild:
Parse + Transform + Bundle + Minify (ALL AT ONCE!)
(Single pass through the code)
```

## Speed Comparison

Let's see how esbuild stacks up:

| Bundler | Build Time (Large Project) |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Webpack | 30-60 seconds |
| Rollup | 20-40 seconds |
| Parcel | 15-30 seconds |
| **esbuild** | **0.5-2 seconds** |

<InfoBox type="analogy" title="Like Instant Coffee vs. Brewing">
Traditional bundlers are like brewing coffee - you wait while it percolates. esbuild is like instant coffee - just add water and it's ready! The result might be slightly different, but the speed is incomparable.

## Getting Started with esbuild

### Installation

```bash
# Install esbuild
npm install esbuild

# Or globally
npm install -g esbuild
```

### Your First Build

```bash
# Bundle a file (CLI)
esbuild src/index.js --bundle --outfile=dist/bundle.js

# With minification
esbuild src/index.js --bundle --minify --outfile=dist/bundle.js

# Watch mode
esbuild src/index.js --bundle --watch --outfile=dist/bundle.js
```

### Using the JavaScript API

```javascript
// build.js
import * as esbuild from 'esbuild'

await esbuild.build({
  entryPoints: ['src/index.js'],
  bundle: true,
  outfile: 'dist/bundle.js',
})

console.log('Build complete! ⚡')
```

Run it:
```bash
node build.js
# Build complete! ⚡ (in milliseconds!)
```

## Basic Configuration

```javascript
// build.js
import * as esbuild from 'esbuild'

await esbuild.build({
  // Entry points (can be multiple)
  entryPoints: ['src/index.js', 'src/worker.js'],
  
  // Bundle all imports into output
  bundle: true,
  
  // Output location
  outdir: 'dist',
  
  // Minify for production
  minify: true,
  
  // Generate source maps
  sourcemap: true,
  
  // Target environment
  target: ['es2020', 'chrome80', 'firefox78'],
  
  // Output format: 'iife', 'cjs', or 'esm'
  format: 'esm',
})
```

## Handling Different File Types

esbuild uses "loaders" to handle different file types:

```javascript
await esbuild.build({
  entryPoints: ['src/index.tsx'],
  bundle: true,
  outfile: 'dist/bundle.js',
  
  loader: {
    '.png': 'file',      // Copy to output, return URL
    '.svg': 'dataurl',   // Inline as base64 data URL
    '.json': 'json',     // Parse as JSON
    '.css': 'css',       // Bundle CSS
    '.txt': 'text',      // Import as string
  },
})
```

### Built-in Loaders

| Loader | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `js` | JavaScript (default for .js) |
| `jsx` | JavaScript with JSX |
| `ts` | TypeScript |
| `tsx` | TypeScript with JSX |
| `css` | CSS files |
| `json` | JSON files |
| `text` | Plain text (as string) |
| `file` | Copy file, return URL |
| `dataurl` | Inline as base64 |

## When to Use esbuild

###  Great For:
- **Library bundling** - Fast builds, simple output
- **Development tooling** - Powers Vite's dev server
- **Simple applications** - When you don't need complex plugins
- **TypeScript compilation** - Fastest TS → JS conversion

### ️ Consider Alternatives When:
- You need complex code transformations
- You require extensive plugin ecosystem
- You need CSS Modules with scoped names
- You need advanced code splitting strategies

<InfoBox type="tip" title="esbuild + Other Tools">
esbuild is often used as a component in other tools! Vite uses esbuild for dependency pre-bundling and TypeScript compilation. You get esbuild's speed without giving up other features.
