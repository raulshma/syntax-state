# Azure DevOps Pipelines

Imagine you're putting on a theater show . You need a backstage crew to handle lighting, sound, costumes, and set changes. **Azure DevOps Pipelines is like that backstage crew for your software** — it handles all the behind-the-scenes work of building, testing, and deploying your code!

## The Theater Production Analogy 

| **Theater Concept** | **Azure DevOps Equivalent** |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| The Script | Your source code |
| Backstage Crew | Azure Pipelines |
| Dress Rehearsal | Staging environment |
| Opening Night | Production deployment |
| Stage Directions | Pipeline YAML file |

<InfoBox type="tip">
  **Azure DevOps** is Microsoft's complete DevOps platform. **Pipelines** is just one service — it handles CI/CD while other services handle code repos, work items, testing, and artifacts.
</InfoBox>

## What is Azure DevOps Pipelines? 

Azure DevOps Pipelines is a cloud service that automatically:
- **Builds** your code (compiles it into an application)
- **Tests** your code (runs automated tests)
- **Deploys** your code (releases it to servers)

## Your First Pipeline: The Basics 

A pipeline is defined in a YAML file called `azure-pipelines.yml`:

```yaml
# azure-pipelines.yml
trigger:
  - main  # Run when code is pushed to main branch

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # Use a Linux machine

steps:
  - task: UseDotNet@2
    displayName: 'Install .NET 8'
    inputs:
      version: '8.0.x'
  
  - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
    displayName: 'Restore packages'
    inputs:
      command: 'restore'
  
  - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
    displayName: 'Build'
    inputs:
      command: 'build'
      arguments: '--configuration Release'
  
  - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
    displayName: 'Run Tests'
    inputs:
      command: 'test'
```

## Key Concepts for Beginners

### Triggers (When to Run) 

```yaml
trigger:
  - main        # Run on push to main
  - develop     # Also run on develop
```

### Pool (Where to Run) 

The pool is the machine that runs your code:

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'   # Linux
  # vmImage: 'windows-latest' # Windows
  # vmImage: 'macos-latest'   # macOS
```

### Tasks (What to Do) 

Tasks are pre-built actions provided by Microsoft:

```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2       # The task name and version
  displayName: 'Build'         # Friendly name in the UI
  inputs:                      # Configuration for the task
    command: 'build'
    projects: '**/*.csproj'
```

<KeyConcept title="The Azure DevOps Task Library">
  Azure DevOps has **hundreds of pre-built tasks** for common operations:
  - `DotNetCoreCLI@2` - .NET commands
  - `AzureWebApp@1` - Deploy to Azure
  - `Docker@2` - Build Docker images
  - `PublishTestResults@2` - Show test results
</KeyConcept>

## Classic Editor vs YAML Pipelines

Azure DevOps offers two ways to create pipelines:

| **Classic Editor** | **YAML Pipelines** |
| :----------------- | :----------------- |
| Visual drag-and-drop | Code-based definition |
| Stored in Azure DevOps | Stored in your repo |
| Easier to start | Version controlled |
| Less flexible | More powerful |

<InfoBox type="info">
  **Best Practice:** Use YAML pipelines! They're stored with your code, so you can review changes, rollback, and share across projects.
</InfoBox>

## Understanding Agents 🤖

An **agent** is the machine that runs your pipeline:

- **Microsoft-hosted agents** - Managed by Microsoft, fresh VM for each run
- **Self-hosted agents** - Your own machines, can access internal resources

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # Microsoft-hosted

# OR

pool:
  name: 'MyPrivatePool'     # Self-hosted pool
```

## Viewing Pipeline Results 

When your pipeline runs, you can see:
-  Which steps passed
-  Which steps failed
-  Logs from each step
- ⏱️ How long each step took

## Why Choose Azure DevOps?

-  **Enterprise-ready** - Built for large organizations
-  **Azure integration** - Seamless deployment to Azure services
-  **Visual interface** - Easy to monitor and manage
-  **Built-in artifact storage** - Keep your build outputs
-  **Work item integration** - Link builds to tickets

## Key Takeaways

-  **Azure Pipelines** automates your software delivery process
-  **YAML files** define what your pipeline does
-  **Agents** are the machines that run your pipelines
-  **Tasks** are pre-built actions for common operations
-  **Microsoft-hosted or self-hosted** agents are available
