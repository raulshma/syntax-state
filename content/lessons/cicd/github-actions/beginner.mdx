# GitHub Actions for .NET

Imagine you have a robot assistant that can automatically check your homework every time you turn it in 🤖. **That's what GitHub Actions does for your code!** It's like having a tireless helper that builds, tests, and deploys your .NET projects whenever you make changes.

## The Factory Assembly Line Analogy 

Think of GitHub Actions like a modern car factory:

| **Manual Process**  | **GitHub Actions** 🤖 |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| Developer runs tests manually | Tests run automatically |
| Remember to build before deploy | Build happens every time |
| Human errors in deployment | Consistent, repeatable process |
| Works only during office hours | Works 24/7, never sleeps |

<InfoBox type="tip">
  **GitHub Actions** = Automated workflows that run when specific events happen in your repository (like pushing code or creating a pull request).
</InfoBox>

## What is a Workflow? 

A workflow is like a recipe that tells GitHub exactly what to do. It's written in a file called YAML (rhymes with "camel").

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build.yml
name: Build My App

on: push  # When to run: every time code is pushed

jobs:
  build:  # Name of the job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # The computer to use
    steps:  # The tasks to do
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4      # Get the code
      - uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4  # Install .NET
      - run: dotnet build              # Build the project
```

## Your First .NET Workflow 

Let's see how a simple workflow works for a .NET project:

<GitHubActionsVisualizer mode="beginner" showYaml={true} interactive={true} />

**What's happening here?**

1. ** Checkout** - Downloads your code from GitHub
2. **️ Setup .NET** - Installs the .NET SDK on the runner
3. ** Restore** - Downloads NuGet packages your project needs
4. ** Build** - Compiles your C# code
5. **🧪 Test** - Runs all your unit tests

## Key Concepts for Beginners

### Events (When to Run) 

```yaml
on:
  push:         # Someone pushed code
  pull_request: # Someone opened a PR
```

### Jobs (What to Do) 

Jobs are groups of steps that run on the same machine:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use a Linux machine
```

### Steps (Individual Tasks) 

Steps are the actual commands:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Build the project
    run: dotnet build
```

<KeyConcept title="The Three Building Blocks">
  **Workflow** = The whole recipe (YAML file)

  **Job** = A group of related steps

  **Step** = A single task (like "run tests")
</KeyConcept>

## Why Use GitHub Actions?

-  **Free for public repos** - No cost to get started
-  **Built into GitHub** - No extra service to set up
-  **Catch bugs early** - Tests run on every push
-  **Professional workflow** - Industry standard practice

## Key Takeaways

- 🤖 **GitHub Actions automates** repetitive tasks like building and testing
-  **Workflows are YAML files** stored in `.github/workflows/`
-  **Events trigger workflows** (push, pull request, schedule)
-  **Jobs contain steps** that run in sequence on a machine
