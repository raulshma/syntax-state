# CSS Grid

Welcome to CSS Grid! CSS Grid is a powerful two-dimensional layout system that lets you create complex layouts with rows and columns. While Flexbox is great for one-dimensional layouts (either rows or columns), Grid excels at two-dimensional layouts where you need precise control over both.

Think of CSS Grid like a spreadsheet or a chessboard: you define rows and columns, and then place items exactly where you want them. It's perfect for page layouts, image galleries, dashboards, and any design that needs a structured grid.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Why Learn This?">
CSS Grid is essential for modern web layouts. It makes complex designs simple and maintainable. Whether you're building a magazine-style layout, a photo gallery, or a dashboard, Grid gives you the power to create professional layouts with clean, readable CSS.

## Grid Container and Grid Items

Just like Flexbox, CSS Grid works with two types of elements:

1. **Grid Container** - The parent element with `display: grid`
2. **Grid Items** - The direct children of the grid container

```css
/* Create a grid container */
.container {
  display: grid;
}
```

When you set `display: grid` on an element, its direct children automatically become grid items. The container defines the grid structure (rows and columns), and the items are placed into that grid.

<KeyConcept title="Grid vs Flexbox">
**When to use Grid:**
- You need control over both rows AND columns
- You're creating a page layout or complex structure
- You want to place items in specific grid cells

**When to use Flexbox:**
- You're arranging items in a single row or column
- You want items to wrap naturally
- You're creating navigation bars, button groups, or simple layouts

Often, you'll use both together - Grid for the overall page layout, Flexbox for components within grid items!

## Grid Template: Defining Columns and Rows

The `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties define the structure of your grid.

```css
/* Create 3 equal columns */
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}

/* Create 2 rows of 100px each */
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
}
```

**Understanding `fr` (fraction unit):**
The `fr` unit represents a fraction of the available space. Think of it like slicing a pie:
- `1fr 1fr 1fr` = three equal slices (33.3% each)
- `2fr 1fr 1fr` = first slice is twice as big (50%, 25%, 25%)

**Other sizing options:**
- **Fixed sizes**: `200px`, `10rem`
- **Percentages**: `25%`, `50%`
- **Auto**: Size based on content
- **Minmax**: `minmax(100px, 1fr)` - minimum 100px, maximum 1fr

Let's see this in action:

<GridPlayground
  initialColumns="1fr 1fr 1fr"
  initialRows="100px 100px"
  initialGap={{ row: 10, column: 10 }}
  initialItems={6}
  showControls={true}
  showGridLines={true}
/>

Try changing the grid template in the playground above:
- Change `1fr 1fr 1fr` to `2fr 1fr 1fr` to make the first column wider
- Change `100px 100px` to `auto auto` to size rows by content
- Try `repeat(3, 1fr)` as a shorthand for `1fr 1fr 1fr`

## Grid Gaps: Spacing Between Items

The `gap` property (or `row-gap` and `column-gap`) adds space between grid items - like the gutters in a magazine layout.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px; /* 20px gap between all items */
}

/* Or control row and column gaps separately */
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  row-gap: 20px;
  column-gap: 10px;
}
```

<KeyConcept title="Gap vs Margin">
**Why use `gap` instead of `margin`?**

`gap` is better because:
- It only adds space BETWEEN items (not on the edges)
- You don't need to worry about removing margin from first/last items
- It's cleaner and more maintainable

```css
/* Old way with margin (messy) */
.item {
  margin: 10px;
}
.item:first-child {
  margin-left: 0;
}

/* New way with gap (clean!) */
.container {
  gap: 20px;
}
```
</KeyConcept>

Try adjusting the gap in the playground above to see how it affects spacing!

## Grid Placement: Positioning Items

By default, grid items are placed automatically in order. But you can place items in specific grid cells using line numbers.

**Understanding Grid Lines:**
Grid lines are the invisible lines that define the grid structure:
- A 3-column grid has 4 vertical lines (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4)
- A 2-row grid has 3 horizontal lines (numbered 1, 2, 3)

```css
/* Place an item from column line 1 to 3 (spans 2 columns) */
.item {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
}

/* Place an item from row line 1 to 3 (spans 2 rows) */
.item {
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}

/* Shorthand: span 2 columns */
.item {
  grid-column: span 2;
}
```

**Common placement patterns:**

```css
/* Full-width header */
.header {
  grid-column: 1 / -1; /* From first to last line */
}

/* Sidebar spanning 2 rows */
.sidebar {
  grid-row: span 2;
}

/* Featured item taking 2x2 space */
.featured {
  grid-column: span 2;
  grid-row: span 2;
}
```

<KeyConcept title="Negative Line Numbers">
You can use negative numbers to count from the end:
- `-1` is the last line
- `-2` is the second-to-last line

This is perfect for full-width items: `grid-column: 1 / -1` means "from the first line to the last line" regardless of how many columns you have!
</KeyConcept>

## Grid Areas: Named Regions

Grid areas let you name regions of your grid and place items by name instead of line numbers. This makes your CSS much more readable!

```css
/* Define named areas */
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar main"
    "footer footer";
}

/* Place items in named areas */
.header {
  grid-area: header;
}

.sidebar {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}

.main {
  grid-area: main;
}

.footer {
  grid-area: footer;
}
```

This creates a classic layout with a header, sidebar, main content, and footer - and the CSS clearly shows the structure!

**Visual representation:**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│       header        │
├──────────┬──────────┤
│ sidebar  │   main   │
│          │          │
├──────────┴──────────┤
│       footer        │
└─────────────────────┘
```

<KeyConcept title="Grid Areas Are Powerful">
Grid areas make your code self-documenting. When you see:

```css
grid-template-areas:
  "header header header"
  "sidebar main main"
  "footer footer footer";
```

You can instantly visualize the layout! This is much clearer than working with line numbers.

## Auto-Placement: Letting Grid Do the Work

When you don't specify placement for items, Grid automatically places them using the auto-placement algorithm.

```css
/* Items flow in rows (default) */
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-auto-flow: row;
}

/* Items flow in columns */
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-auto-flow: column;
}
```

**Auto-placement is perfect for:**
- Image galleries where items flow naturally
- Card layouts that adapt to content
- Responsive designs that reflow at different screen sizes

```css
/* Responsive card grid */
.card-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

This creates a grid that automatically adjusts the number of columns based on available space - cards will wrap to new rows as needed!

<KeyConcept title="Auto-Fit vs Auto-Fill">
- **`auto-fit`**: Collapses empty tracks, stretching items to fill space
- **`auto-fill`**: Keeps empty tracks, maintaining consistent sizing

For most responsive layouts, `auto-fit` is what you want!
