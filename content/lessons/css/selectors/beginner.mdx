# CSS Selectors

Welcome to CSS Selectors! Think of selectors as **address labels** for your HTML elements. Just like you need an address to send a letter to the right house, you need selectors to apply styles to the right elements on your web page.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to target specific elements, groups of elements, and even elements in specific states. By the end, you'll be able to style any element on your page with precision!

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Why Learn Selectors?">
Selectors are the foundation of CSS. Without them, you can't apply any styles! Mastering selectors means you can style anything on your page exactly the way you want.

## Basic Selectors

Let's start with the three most common selectors you'll use every day.

### Element Selector

The **element selector** targets all elements of a specific type. It's like saying "style all the paragraphs" or "style all the headings."

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}
```

This makes **all** `<p>` elements blue. Simple!

### Class Selector

The **class selector** targets elements with a specific class attribute. Classes are like name tags you can give to multiple elements.

```html
<p class="highlight">This paragraph is special!</p>
<p>This one is normal.</p>
```

```css
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

Notice the **dot (.)** before the class name in CSS. Only the first paragraph gets the yellow background because it has the `highlight` class.

<KeyConcept title="Classes Are Reusable">
You can use the same class on multiple elements. That's what makes classes so powerful — one style rule can affect many elements!
</KeyConcept>

### ID Selector

The **ID selector** targets a single, unique element. IDs are like social security numbers — each element can only have one, and it should be unique on the page.

```html
<div id="header">Welcome to my site!</div>
```

```css
#header {
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

Notice the **hash (#)** before the ID name in CSS.

<InfoBox type="warning" title="IDs Should Be Unique">
Each ID should only appear once per page. If you need to style multiple elements the same way, use classes instead!
</InfoBox>

### Try It Yourself!

<SelectorPlayground 
  initialHtml={`<div>
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p class="intro">This is an introduction.</p>
  <p>This is a regular paragraph.</p>
  <p class="intro">Another intro paragraph.</p>
  <div id="special">I'm unique!</div>
</div>`}
  initialSelector="p"
  showSpecificity={false}
  highlightMatches={true}
/>

## Combinators

Combinators let you select elements based on their **relationship** to other elements. Think of them as ways to describe family relationships in your HTML tree.

### Descendant Selector (Space)

The **descendant selector** targets elements inside other elements, no matter how deep.

```css
div p {
  color: green;
}
```

This selects all `<p>` elements that are **anywhere inside** a `<div>`, even if they're nested several levels deep.

```html
<div>
  <p>I'm green!</p>
  <section>
    <p>I'm also green!</p>
  </section>
</div>
<p>I'm not green (not inside a div).</p>
```

### Child Selector (>)

The **child selector** is more specific — it only targets **direct children**.

```css
div > p {
  color: red;
}
```

```html
<div>
  <p>I'm red! (direct child)</p>
  <section>
    <p>I'm not red (grandchild, not direct child).</p>
  </section>
</div>
```

<KeyConcept title="Descendant vs Child">
**Descendant** (space) = any level deep. **Child** (>) = only direct children. Think of it like family: descendants include children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc., but children are just the next generation.
</KeyConcept>

### Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)

The **adjacent sibling selector** targets an element that comes **immediately after** another element (same parent).

```css
h1 + p {
  font-size: 18px;
}
```

This selects a `<p>` that comes **right after** an `<h1>`.

```html
<h1>Title</h1>
<p>I'm 18px! (right after h1)</p>
<p>I'm normal size (not right after h1).</p>
```

### General Sibling Selector (~)

The **general sibling selector** targets **all** siblings that come after an element.

```css
h1 ~ p {
  color: gray;
}
```

This selects **all** `<p>` elements that come after an `<h1>` (with the same parent).

<SelectorPlayground 
  initialHtml={`<div>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>First paragraph</p>
  <p>Second paragraph</p>
  <span>A span</span>
  <p>Third paragraph</p>
</div>`}
  initialSelector="h1 ~ p"
  showSpecificity={false}
  highlightMatches={true}
/>

## Pseudo-classes

**Pseudo-classes** let you select elements based on their **state** or **position**. They always start with a colon (:).

### Interactive States

These pseudo-classes respond to user interaction:

#### :hover
Applies when the user hovers over an element with their mouse.

```css
button:hover {
  background-color: blue;
}
```

#### :focus
Applies when an element has keyboard focus (like when you tab to a button or click in an input field).

```css
input:focus {
  border-color: green;
}
```

#### :active
Applies when an element is being clicked.

```css
button:active {
  transform: scale(0.95);
}
```

### Position-based Pseudo-classes

These select elements based on their position among siblings:

#### :first-child
Selects an element if it's the first child of its parent.

```css
p:first-child {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

#### :last-child
Selects an element if it's the last child of its parent.

```css
p:last-child {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
```

#### :nth-child(n)
Selects elements based on their position. You can use numbers or formulas!

```css
/* Every odd row */
tr:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

/* Every 3rd element */
li:nth-child(3n) {
  color: red;
}
```

<InfoBox type="info" title="Pseudo-classes Are Powerful">
Pseudo-classes let you create interactive effects and style patterns without adding extra classes to your HTML. They're one of CSS's superpowers!
</InfoBox>

<SelectorPlayground 
  initialHtml={`<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
  <li>Fifth item</li>
</ul>`}
  initialSelector="li:nth-child(odd)"
  showSpecificity={false}
  highlightMatches={true}
/>

## Attribute Selectors

**Attribute selectors** let you target elements based on their attributes and attribute values. They use square brackets [].

### Basic Attribute Selector

Select elements that have a specific attribute:

```css
[disabled] {
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```

This selects any element with a `disabled` attribute.

### Exact Value Match

Select elements where an attribute equals a specific value:

```css
[type="text"] {
  border: 1px solid gray;
}
```

This selects elements where `type="text"` exactly.

### Contains Value

Select elements where an attribute contains a specific value:

```css
[class*="btn"] {
  padding: 10px;
}
```

This selects elements whose class contains "btn" anywhere (like "btn-primary", "submit-btn", etc.).

### Starts With

Select elements where an attribute starts with a specific value:

```css
[href^="https"] {
  color: green;
}
```

This selects links that start with "https".

### Ends With

Select elements where an attribute ends with a specific value:

```css
[src$=".jpg"] {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

This selects images that end with ".jpg".

<KeyConcept title="Attribute Selectors Are Flexible">
Attribute selectors are great for styling elements based on their attributes without adding extra classes. They're especially useful for forms and links!
</KeyConcept>

<SelectorPlayground 
  initialHtml={`<div>
  <input type="text" placeholder="Name">
  <input type="email" placeholder="Email">
  <input type="password" placeholder="Password">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</div>`}
  initialSelector="[type='text']"
  showSpecificity={false}
  highlightMatches={true}
/>

## Specificity Basics

When multiple CSS rules target the same element, **specificity** determines which rule wins. Think of it as a **priority system**.

### The Specificity Hierarchy

From **lowest** to **highest** priority:

1. **Element selectors** (e.g., `p`, `div`) — 1 point
2. **Class selectors** (e.g., `.highlight`) — 10 points
3. **ID selectors** (e.g., `#header`) — 100 points
4. **Inline styles** (e.g., `style="color: red"`) — 1000 points

### How It Works

```css
p {
  color: blue;  /* Specificity: 1 */
}

.highlight {
  color: yellow;  /* Specificity: 10 */
}

#special {
  color: red;  /* Specificity: 100 */
}
```

```html
<p>I'm blue (only element selector applies)</p>
<p class="highlight">I'm yellow (class beats element)</p>
<p id="special" class="highlight">I'm red (ID beats class)</p>
```

<InfoBox type="tip" title="The Golden Rule">
The more specific your selector, the higher its priority. But don't overuse IDs — they make your CSS harder to override later!
</InfoBox>

### Combining Selectors

When you combine selectors, their specificity adds up:

```css
div.highlight {
  /* Specificity: 1 (div) + 10 (class) = 11 */
  color: green;
}

.highlight {
  /* Specificity: 10 */
  color: yellow;
}
```

The first rule wins because 11 > 10!
