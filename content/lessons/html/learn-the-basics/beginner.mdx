# Learn the Basics of HTML

Welcome to HTML! HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**, and it's the foundation of every website you've ever visited. Don't worry if that sounds complicated — we'll break it down together.

Think of HTML as **building blocks** for web pages. Just like LEGO bricks snap together to create amazing structures, HTML elements combine to create websites!

## The Building Blocks Analogy

Imagine you're building a house with LEGO:

- **Bricks** are the basic pieces (like HTML elements)
- **Instructions** tell you how to arrange them (like HTML structure)
- **The finished house** is what people see (like a web page)

HTML works the same way! You use different "pieces" (called **elements**) and arrange them to create web pages.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="What Makes HTML Special?">
HTML isn't a programming language — it's a markup language. This means it describes the structure and content of a page, not how it behaves. Think of it as the skeleton of a website!

## What Are HTML Elements?

An HTML element is like a labeled container. It has:

1. **An opening tag** — tells the browser "start here"
2. **Content** — what goes inside
3. **A closing tag** — tells the browser "end here"

Here's what it looks like:

```html
<p>Hello, World!</p>
```

- `<p>` is the opening tag (p stands for "paragraph")
- `Hello, World!` is the content
- `</p>` is the closing tag (notice the `/`)

<KeyConcept title="Tags vs Elements">
A **tag** is the code in angle brackets like `<p>`. An **element** is the complete package: opening tag + content + closing tag.
</KeyConcept>

## The Basic Structure of a Web Page

Every HTML page follows the same basic structure. Think of it like a letter with specific parts:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's break this down:

### 1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`
This tells the browser "Hey, this is an HTML5 document!" Always put this first.

### 2. `<html>`
The root element that contains everything else. It's like the outer box that holds all your LEGO pieces.

### 3. `<head>`
Contains information *about* the page (like the title), but nothing you see on the page itself.

### 4. `<body>`
Contains everything you *see* on the page — text, images, buttons, everything!

<InfoBox type="info" title="The Head vs Body">
Think of `<head>` as the backstage area (metadata, settings) and `<body>` as the stage (what the audience sees).
</InfoBox>

## Common HTML Elements

Let's learn some elements you'll use all the time:

### Headings (h1 to h6)

Headings create titles and subtitles. `<h1>` is the biggest, `<h6>` is the smallest.

```html
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Section Title</h2>
<h3>Subsection Title</h3>
```

### Paragraphs

The `<p>` element creates paragraphs of text.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph. It can contain lots of text.</p>
```

### Links

The `<a>` element creates clickable links.

```html
<a href="https://example.com">Click me!</a>
```

### Images

The `<img>` element displays images. It's special — it doesn't need a closing tag!

```html
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="A cute cat">
```

<ElementExplorer initialCategory="text" />

## Nesting Elements

Elements can go inside other elements — this is called **nesting**. It's like putting smaller LEGO pieces inside bigger ones.

```html
<div>
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>This paragraph is <strong>inside</strong> the div.</p>
</div>
```

### The Golden Rule of Nesting

Always close tags in the **reverse order** you opened them:

 Correct:
```html
<p>This is <strong>bold</strong> text.</p>
```

 Wrong:
```html
<p>This is <strong>bold</p></strong>
```

<KeyConcept title="Proper Nesting">
Think of nesting like Russian dolls — the last one you open should be the first one you close!
