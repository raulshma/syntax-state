# SEO Basics

Welcome to Search Engine Optimization! SEO is about helping search engines understand your content so they can show it to people searching for related topics.

Think of SEO like **writing a good book cover and table of contents**. Just as these help readers find and understand a book, good SEO helps search engines find and understand your website.

## What is SEO?

SEO stands for **Search Engine Optimization**. It's the practice of making your website easier for search engines like Google to:

- **Find** your pages (crawling)
- **Understand** your content (indexing)
- **Show** your pages in search results (ranking)

When someone searches for "learn web development," search engines look through billions of pages to find the most relevant results. Good SEO helps your page be one of those results!

<InfoBox type="tip" title="SEO is About Helping Users">
The best SEO strategy is creating helpful content that answers people's questions. Search engines reward pages that genuinely help users.

## How Search Engines Work

Search engines follow three main steps:

### 1. Crawling
Search engine "bots" (also called spiders) visit websites and follow links to discover pages. They're like librarians exploring a huge library.

### 2. Indexing
After crawling, search engines analyze and store information about each page. They note the title, content, images, and more.

### 3. Ranking
When someone searches, the engine looks through its index and ranks pages by relevance and quality. The best matches appear first.

<KeyConcept title="Be Crawlable, Indexable, and Valuable">
Your page needs to be found (crawlable), understood (indexable), and helpful (valuable) to rank well.
</KeyConcept>

## The Title Tag

The `<title>` tag is the most important SEO element. It appears in:
- Browser tabs
- Search results (as the clickable headline)
- Social media shares

```html
<head>
  <title>Learn Web Development | SyntaxState</title>
</head>
```

### Writing Good Titles

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
|-------|---------|
| Keep it under 60 characters | Write super long titles that get cut off... |
| Include your main keyword | Stuff keywords unnaturally |
| Make it descriptive and unique | Use "Home" or "Page 1" |
| Put important words first | Start with your brand name |

<InfoBox type="info" title="Character Limits Matter">
Google typically shows 50-60 characters of your title. Anything longer gets cut off with "..." which looks unprofessional and loses information.
</InfoBox>

## The Meta Description

The meta description is a summary of your page that appears in search results below the title.

```html
<head>
  <meta name="description" content="Master web development with interactive lessons, hands-on projects, and AI-powered learning paths. Start your coding journey today.">
</head>
```

### Writing Good Descriptions

- **Length**: 150-160 characters (longer gets truncated)
- **Content**: Summarize what the page offers
- **Action**: Include a call-to-action when appropriate
- **Keywords**: Include relevant terms naturally

<KeyConcept title="Descriptions Don't Affect Ranking">
Meta descriptions don't directly affect your search ranking, but they do affect whether people click on your result. A compelling description = more clicks!
</KeyConcept>

## Heading Hierarchy

Headings (h1-h6) help both users and search engines understand your content structure.

```html
<h1>Main Page Title</h1>           <!-- Only one per page -->
  <h2>Major Section</h2>           <!-- Main topics -->
    <h3>Subsection</h3>            <!-- Subtopics -->
    <h3>Another Subsection</h3>
  <h2>Another Major Section</h2>
```

### Heading Best Practices

1. **One H1 per page** - This is your main title
2. **Don't skip levels** - Go h1 → h2 → h3, not h1 → h3
3. **Be descriptive** - "Our Services" is better than "Section 2"
4. **Include keywords** - But naturally, not forced

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Headings Are Not for Styling">
Don't use `<h3>` just because you want smaller text. Use CSS for styling and headings for structure.
</InfoBox>
