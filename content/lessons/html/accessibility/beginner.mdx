# Accessibility

Welcome to Web Accessibility! Accessibility (often called "a11y") is about making websites usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.

Think of accessibility like **building ramps alongside stairs**. Just as ramps help people in wheelchairs, good web accessibility helps people who use screen readers, keyboards, or other assistive technologies.

<AccessibilityChecker initialExample="good-example" />

## Why Accessibility Matters

Imagine trying to use a website:
- **Without seeing** - using a screen reader that reads content aloud
- **Without a mouse** - navigating only with a keyboard
- **With limited vision** - needing high contrast or large text
- **With motor difficulties** - needing larger click targets

About **15% of the world's population** has some form of disability. Making your website accessible means more people can use it!

<InfoBox type="tip" title="It's Also Good for Everyone">
Accessibility improvements often help all users! Captions help in noisy environments, keyboard navigation is faster for power users, and clear structure helps everyone understand content.

## The Four Principles (POUR)

Web accessibility is built on four main principles, remembered as POUR:

### 1. Perceivable
Users must be able to perceive the content. This means:
- Images need text descriptions (alt text)
- Videos need captions
- Text needs sufficient color contrast

### 2. Operable
Users must be able to operate the interface:
- Everything should work with a keyboard
- Users need enough time to read content
- Nothing should cause seizures (no rapid flashing)

### 3. Understandable
Content must be understandable:
- Text should be readable
- Pages should work predictably
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust
Content must work with different technologies:
- Works with current and future browsers
- Works with assistive technologies
- Uses proper HTML standards

<KeyConcept title="POUR = Accessible">
If your website is Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust, it's accessible!
</KeyConcept>

## Essential Accessibility Practices

Let's look at the most important things you can do right now:

### 1. Add Alt Text to Images

```html
<!-- Good: Describes the image -->
<img src="puppy.jpg" alt="Golden retriever puppy playing in the park">

<!-- Good: Empty alt for decorative images -->
<img src="decorative-line.png" alt="">

<!-- Bad: Missing alt text -->
<img src="important-chart.png">
```

<InfoBox type="info" title="What Makes Good Alt Text?">
Describe what the image shows and why it matters. For a chart, describe the data. For a photo, describe what's happening. For decorative images, use empty alt="".
</InfoBox>

### 2. Use Proper Headings

```html
<!-- Good: Logical heading order -->
<h1>Page Title</h1>
  <h2>Section One</h2>
    <h3>Subsection</h3>
  <h2>Section Two</h2>

<!-- Bad: Skipping heading levels -->
<h1>Page Title</h1>
  <h4>This skips h2 and h3!</h4>
```

### 3. Label Your Forms

```html
<!-- Good: Label connected to input -->
<label for="email">Email Address:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email">

<!-- Bad: No label -->
<input type="email" placeholder="Enter email">
```

## How Screen Readers Work

Screen readers are software that reads web content aloud. They rely on proper HTML to understand your page.

<ScreenReaderSimulator initialExample="semantic-page" />

### What Screen Readers Announce

Screen readers tell users about:
- **Landmarks** - "Navigation", "Main content", "Footer"
- **Headings** - "Heading level 1, Welcome"
- **Links** - "Link, About Us"
- **Form fields** - "Email, edit text, required"
- **Images** - "Image, Golden retriever puppy"

<KeyConcept title="Semantic HTML = Better Announcements">
When you use proper HTML elements like `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<button>`, screen readers automatically know what they are!
</KeyConcept>

## Keyboard Navigation Basics

Many users navigate websites using only a keyboard. Here's how it works:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Tab | Move to next interactive element |
| Shift + Tab | Move to previous element |
| Enter | Activate links and buttons |
| Space | Activate buttons, check checkboxes |
| Arrow keys | Navigate within menus, sliders |

### Making Elements Keyboard Accessible

```html
<!-- Good: Button is automatically focusable -->
<button onclick="doSomething()">Click Me</button>

<!-- Bad: Div is not keyboard accessible -->
<div onclick="doSomething()">Click Me</div>
```

<InfoBox type="warning" title="The Tab Test">
Try navigating your website using only the Tab key. Can you reach everything? Can you see where you are? If not, there's work to do!
</InfoBox>

## Key Takeaways

<KeyConcept title="Accessibility = Inclusion">
Making websites accessible means everyone can use them, regardless of ability.
</KeyConcept>

<KeyConcept title="Start with the Basics">
Alt text, proper headings, form labels, and keyboard access cover most accessibility needs.
</KeyConcept>

<KeyConcept title="Use Semantic HTML">
Proper HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`) are automatically more accessible than generic `<div>` elements.
</KeyConcept>
