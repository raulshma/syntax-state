# Writing Semantic HTML

Welcome to semantic HTML! You've learned the basics of HTML elements — now let's learn how to use them **meaningfully**. Semantic HTML is about choosing the right element for the job, not just any element that looks right.

Think of it like organizing a newspaper. A newspaper has clear sections: the headline, the main story, sidebars, and the footer with contact info. Semantic HTML gives your web page the same clear structure!

<StructureComparison initialExample="page-layout" />

## The Newspaper Analogy

Imagine you're designing a newspaper:

- **Header** — The masthead with the newspaper name and navigation
- **Main Story** — The primary content readers came for
- **Sidebar** — Related articles or advertisements
- **Footer** — Contact info, copyright, and links

HTML has elements that match these exact purposes! Instead of using generic `<div>` elements for everything, we use **semantic elements** that describe what the content actually is.

Semantic HTML helps search engines understand your content, makes your site accessible to screen readers, and makes your code easier to read and maintain. It's a win-win-win!

## What is Semantic HTML?

**Semantic** means "relating to meaning." Semantic HTML elements clearly describe their purpose:

- `<header>` — "This is the header section"
- `<nav>` — "This contains navigation links"
- `<main>` — "This is the main content"
- `<footer>` — "This is the footer section"

Compare this to non-semantic elements like `<div>` and `<span>`, which just say "this is a container" without any meaning.

```html
<!-- Non-semantic (div soup) -->
<div class="header">
  <div class="nav">...</div>
</div>

<!-- Semantic (meaningful) -->
<header>
  <nav>...</nav>
</header>
```

Both look the same visually, but the semantic version tells browsers, search engines, and screen readers exactly what each part is!

<KeyConcept title="Semantic = Meaningful">
Semantic elements describe their content's purpose. Non-semantic elements like `<div>` are just generic containers with no inherent meaning.
</KeyConcept>

## The Main Semantic Elements

Let's meet the most important semantic elements:

### `<header>` — The Introduction

Contains introductory content or navigation. Usually at the top of a page or section.

```html
<header>
  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <nav>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/about">About</a>
  </nav>
</header>
```

### `<nav>` — Navigation Links

Contains navigation links to other pages or sections.

```html
<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <a href="/products">Products</a>
  <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
</nav>
```

### `<main>` — The Star of the Show

Contains the primary content of your page. There should only be **one** `<main>` per page!

```html
<main>
  <h1>Welcome to Our Store</h1>
  <p>Browse our amazing products...</p>
</main>
```

### `<footer>` — The Closing Section

Contains footer information like copyright, contact details, or site links.

```html
<footer>
  <p>© 2024 My Company</p>
  <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>
</footer>
```

## Building a Semantic Page Structure

Let's put it all together! Here's a complete semantic page structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>My Semantic Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>My Website</h1>
    <nav>
      <a href="/">Home</a>
      <a href="/about">About</a>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>This is the main content.</p>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <p>© 2024 My Website</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

<SemanticStructureBuilder />

<InfoBox type="info" title="One Main Per Page">
Remember: you should only have ONE `<main>` element per page. It represents the unique content of that page.
</InfoBox>

## Why Semantic HTML Matters

### 1. Accessibility

Screen readers use semantic elements to help visually impaired users navigate. They can jump directly to the `<main>` content or `<nav>` section!

### 2. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

Search engines like Google understand semantic elements. Using `<article>` for blog posts helps Google know it's a standalone piece of content.

### 3. Easier to Read

Compare these two code snippets:

```html
<!-- Hard to understand -->
<div class="top">
  <div class="links">...</div>
</div>

<!-- Easy to understand -->
<header>
  <nav>...</nav>
</header>
```

The semantic version is self-documenting!

1. **Accessibility** — Screen readers can navigate your page
2. **SEO** — Search engines understand your content
3. **Maintainability** — Code is easier to read and update

## Key Takeaways

<KeyConcept title="Use the Right Element">
Choose elements based on meaning, not appearance. Use `<nav>` for navigation, not `<div class="nav">`.
</KeyConcept>

<KeyConcept title="Structure Like a Newspaper">
Think of your page like a newspaper: header, main content, sidebars, and footer.
</KeyConcept>

<KeyConcept title="One Main Per Page">
Every page should have exactly one `<main>` element containing its primary content.
</KeyConcept>
