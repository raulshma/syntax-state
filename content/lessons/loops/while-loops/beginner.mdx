# while and do...while Loops

Sometimes you don't know how many times you need to repeat something. That's where `while` and `do...while` loops come in!

## The while Loop - Check First

<KeyConcept title="The Bouncer Analogy" icon="user-check">
A `while` loop is like a **bouncer at a club**:

- The bouncer checks your ID **before** letting you in
- If you don't pass the check, you never get in
- Each time you want to re-enter, they check again

The condition is checked **before** each iteration!
</KeyConcept>

### Syntax

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code to repeat
}
```

### Simple Example

```javascript
let count = 0;

while (count < 3) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2
```

## The do...while Loop - Try First

<KeyConcept title="The Try-Before-You-Buy Analogy" icon="shopping-bag">
A `do...while` loop is like a **try-before-you-buy store**:

- You **always get to try once** (the body runs first)
- Then they check if you want to continue
- Even if the condition is false, you still tried once!

The code runs **at least once**, then checks the condition.
</KeyConcept>

### Syntax

```javascript
do {
  // code to repeat (runs at least once!)
} while (condition);
```

### Simple Example

```javascript
let num = 0;

do {
  console.log(num);
  num++;
} while (num < 3);
// Output: 0, 1, 2
```

<LoopVisualizer type="do-while" />

## The Key Difference

Let's see what happens when the condition is **false from the start**:

```javascript
let x = 10;

// while - checks first, never runs
while (x < 5) {
  console.log('while:', x);
  x++;
}
// No output!

// do...while - runs once, then checks
let y = 10;
do {
  console.log('do-while:', y);
  y++;
} while (y < 5);
// Output: "do-while: 10"
```

| Feature | while | do...while |
|:--------|:------|:-----------|
| Checks condition | **Before** body | **After** body |
| Minimum runs | 0 times | **1 time** |
| Use when | Maybe don't need to run | Need to run at least once |

## Real World Examples

### Guessing Game (while)

```javascript
let secretNumber = 7;
let guess = 0;

while (guess !== secretNumber) {
  guess = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
  console.log('Guessed:', guess);
}
console.log('Got it!');
```

### Menu Selection (do...while)

```javascript
let choice;

do {
  console.log('1. Play Game');
  console.log('2. Settings');
  console.log('3. Exit');
  choice = prompt('Choose an option:');
} while (choice !== '3');

console.log('Goodbye!');
```

> **Perfect for menus!** You always want to show the menu at least once.

<CodePlayground 
  code={`// Countdown example
let countdown = 5;

while (countdown > 0) {
  console.log(countdown + '...');
  countdown--;
}
console.log('Blast off! ');`}
  title="Try It: Countdown"
/>

## When to Use Each Loop

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Choosing the Right Loop">
- Use `for` when you know how many times to loop
- Use `while` when you don't know how many times
- Use `do...while` when you need at least one iteration
</InfoBox>

| Scenario | Best Loop |
|:---------|:----------|
| Count 1 to 10 | `for` |
| Read until end of file | `while` |
| Show menu at least once | `do...while` |
| Loop through array | `for` or `for...of` |
| Wait for valid input | `do...while` |
