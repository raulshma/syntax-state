# Isolation Levels: Transaction Visibility

Control what transactions can see of each other's work!

##  What are Isolation Levels?

Isolation levels control how much of other transactions' work you can see:

| Level            | See Uncommitted? | See Changes During Read? | See New Rows? |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Read Uncommitted | Yes              | Yes                      | Yes           |
| Read Committed   | No               | Yes                      | Yes           |
| Repeatable Read  | No               | No                       | Yes           |
| Serializable     | No               | No                       | No            |

##  Setting Isolation Level

```sql
-- SQL Server
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- Work here uses READ COMMITTED isolation
COMMIT;

-- PostgreSQL
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
    -- Work here
COMMIT;
```

##  The Four Levels

### 1. Read Uncommitted (Fastest, Least Safe)

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
-- Can see other transactions' uncommitted changes (dirty reads)
```

### 2. Read Committed (Default in Most DBs)

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
-- Only see committed data
-- Same query might return different results if others commit
```

### 3. Repeatable Read

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
-- Same row always returns same value
-- But new rows might appear (phantom reads)
```

### 4. Serializable (Safest, Slowest)

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
-- Transactions appear to run one after another
-- No anomalies, but slowest
```

##  Simple Example

```sql
-- Transaction A (Read Committed)
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1;  -- Returns 1000

    -- Meanwhile, Transaction B commits: UPDATE balance to 500

    SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = 1;  -- Returns 500 (changed!)
COMMIT;
```

##  Which to Use?

| Use Case                      | Recommended Level |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Most applications             | Read Committed    |
| Reports needing consistency   | Repeatable Read   |
| Financial/Critical            | Serializable      |
| Quick counts (approximate OK) | Read Uncommitted  |
