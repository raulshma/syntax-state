# FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY: Filtering and Sorting

Learn to find exactly what you need and display it in the order you want!

##  FROM: Where's the Data?

The FROM clause tells SQL which table to look at:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;     -- Look in customers table
SELECT * FROM products;      -- Look in products table
SELECT * FROM orders;        -- Look in orders table
```

##  WHERE: Find What You Need

Filter rows that match a condition:

```sql
-- Find customers from New York
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE city = 'New York';

-- Find expensive products
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE price > 100;

-- Find recent orders
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE order_date > '2024-01-01';
```

### Multiple Conditions

Use AND and OR to combine conditions:

```sql
-- AND: Both must be true
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE price > 50 AND category = 'Electronics';

-- OR: Either can be true
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category = 'Books' OR category = 'Music';

-- Combine with parentheses
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE (category = 'Books' OR category = 'Music')
  AND price < 30;
```

##  ORDER BY: Sort Your Results

```sql
-- Sort alphabetically (A to Z)
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY last_name;

-- Sort reverse (Z to A)
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY last_name DESC;

-- Sort by number (highest first)
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC;
```

### Multiple Sort Columns

```sql
-- Sort by city, then by name within each city
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY city, last_name;

-- Mix ascending and descending
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY category ASC, price DESC;
```

##  Putting It All Together

```sql
SELECT
    product_name,
    category,
    price
FROM products
WHERE price > 20
ORDER BY category, price DESC;
```

This query:

1. **FROM** - Looks at the products table
2. **WHERE** - Keeps only products over $20
3. **ORDER BY** - Sorts by category, then by highest price
