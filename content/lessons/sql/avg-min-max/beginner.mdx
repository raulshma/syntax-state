# AVG, MIN, MAX: Finding Averages and Extremes

Calculate averages and find the highest and lowest values!

##  The Three Functions

| Function | What It Does      | Example             |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| `AVG()`  | Calculate average | Average order value |
| `MIN()`  | Find smallest     | Cheapest product    |
| `MAX()`  | Find largest      | Highest salary      |

##  Basic Examples

```sql
-- Average order value
SELECT AVG(total) AS average_order FROM orders;

-- Cheapest and most expensive products
SELECT
    MIN(price) AS cheapest,
    MAX(price) AS most_expensive
FROM products;
```

##  All Together

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_products,
    AVG(price) AS average_price,
    MIN(price) AS cheapest,
    MAX(price) AS most_expensive,
    SUM(price) AS total_value
FROM products;
```

##  With GROUP BY

```sql
-- Stats by category
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(*) AS product_count,
    AVG(price) AS avg_price,
    MIN(price) AS min_price,
    MAX(price) AS max_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

##  MIN/MAX with Text

MIN and MAX work on strings too (alphabetical):

```sql
SELECT
    MIN(name) AS first_alphabetically,
    MAX(name) AS last_alphabetically
FROM customers;
-- First: "Aaron", Last: "Zoe"
```

##  MIN/MAX with Dates

```sql
SELECT
    MIN(order_date) AS first_order,
    MAX(order_date) AS latest_order
FROM orders;
```

## ️ NULL Handling

AVG, MIN, and MAX ignore NULL values:

```sql
-- Values: 10, 20, NULL, 40
SELECT AVG(score) FROM tests;  -- Returns 23.33 (not 17.5!)
-- (10 + 20 + 40) / 3 = 23.33
```

##  Quick Reference

```sql
-- Employee salary stats
SELECT
    department,
    COUNT(*) AS employees,
    AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
    MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary,
    MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```
