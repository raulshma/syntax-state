# COMMIT: Saving Your Changes

Make your transaction changes permanent!

##  What is COMMIT?

COMMIT saves all changes made during the transaction:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = 1000 WHERE id = 1;
COMMIT;  -- Changes are now permanent!
```

##  Syntax

```sql
-- All equivalent
COMMIT;
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
COMMIT WORK;
COMMIT TRAN;  -- SQL Server shorthand
```

##  What COMMIT Does

1. **Makes changes permanent** - Survives crashes
2. **Releases locks** - Other transactions can access data
3. **Ends transaction** - Returns to auto-commit mode
4. **Cannot be undone** - No going back after COMMIT!

##  Complete Example

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- Insert a new order
    INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, total) VALUES (5, 99.99);

    -- Update customer's order count
    UPDATE customers SET order_count = order_count + 1 WHERE id = 5;

    -- Update inventory
    UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1 WHERE id = 10;
COMMIT;  -- All three changes saved together
```

## ️ After COMMIT

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    DELETE FROM old_logs WHERE log_date < '2020-01-01';
COMMIT;

-- CANNOT UNDO! The DELETE is permanent.
-- Only way to recover: restore from backup
```

##  Best Practice

Always explicitly end your transactions:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    -- Work...
    IF @success = 1
        COMMIT;      -- Success path
    ELSE
        ROLLBACK;    -- Failure path
```
