# GROUP BY: Organizing Data into Groups

Learn to group rows together for powerful summaries!

##  What is GROUP BY?

GROUP BY collects rows into groups so you can calculate totals per group:

```sql
-- Without GROUP BY: One total for all
SELECT SUM(total) FROM orders;  -- 50,000

-- With GROUP BY: Total per customer
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total) FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;
-- Customer 1: 5,000
-- Customer 2: 12,000
-- ...
```

##  Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT column, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(other_column)
FROM table
GROUP BY column;
```

##  Simple Examples

```sql
-- Orders per customer
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Revenue per category
SELECT category, SUM(price) AS category_revenue
FROM products
GROUP BY category;

-- Employees per department
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

## ️ The Golden Rule

> Every column in SELECT must be in GROUP BY or an aggregate function!

```sql
-- CORRECT
SELECT category, AVG(price)
FROM products
GROUP BY category;

-- WRONG - name not in GROUP BY or aggregate
SELECT category, name, AVG(price)
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
-- Error!
```

##  Multiple Aggregates

```sql
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(*) AS product_count,
    AVG(price) AS avg_price,
    MIN(price) AS min_price,
    MAX(price) AS max_price,
    SUM(stock) AS total_stock
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

##  With ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM products
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;  -- Highest sales first
```
