# SQL Keywords: The Building Blocks

SQL has special words called **keywords** that tell the database what to do!

##  What Are SQL Keywords?

Keywords are reserved words in SQL that have special meaning. Think of them as **commands** you give to the database.

| Keyword  | What It Does   | Example             |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| `SELECT` | Get data       | SELECT name FROM... |
| `FROM`   | Which table    | ...FROM customers   |
| `WHERE`  | Filter results | WHERE age > 18      |
| `INSERT` | Add new data   | INSERT INTO...      |
| `UPDATE` | Change data    | UPDATE products...  |
| `DELETE` | Remove data    | DELETE FROM...      |

##  The Essential Keywords

### Getting Data (SELECT)

```sql
SELECT name, email
FROM customers;
```

### Adding Data (INSERT)

```sql
INSERT INTO customers (name, email)
VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@email.com');
```

### Changing Data (UPDATE)

```sql
UPDATE customers
SET email = 'new@email.com'
WHERE name = 'Alice';
```

### Removing Data (DELETE)

```sql
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE name = 'Alice';
```

##  Categories of Keywords

| Category              | Keywords               | Purpose           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Data Query**        | SELECT, FROM, WHERE    | Reading data      |
| **Data Modification** | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | Changing data     |
| **Sorting**           | ORDER BY, ASC, DESC    | Arranging results |
| **Filtering**         | WHERE, AND, OR, NOT    | Narrowing results |
| **Grouping**          | GROUP BY, HAVING       | Summarizing data  |

##  Quick Tips

- Keywords are **NOT case-sensitive** (SELECT = select = SeLeCt)
- Convention: Write keywords in **UPPERCASE** for readability
- Keywords **cannot be used** as table or column names (usually)

```sql
-- All of these work the same:
SELECT * FROM customers;
select * from customers;
Select * From Customers;
```
