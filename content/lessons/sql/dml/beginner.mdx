# Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML is all about working with the actual data in your tables. Think of it as the "verbs" of SQL - the actions you can perform!

##  The Four Core Operations (CRUD)

| Operation  | SQL Command | What It Does         |
| :--------- | :---------- | :------------------- |
| **C**reate | INSERT      | Add new data         |
| **R**ead   | SELECT      | Retrieve data        |
| **U**pdate | UPDATE      | Modify existing data |
| **D**elete | DELETE      | Remove data          |

> **Remember:** Most of your SQL work will be SELECT queries. Master them first!

## SELECT - Reading Data

The most important SQL command. Let&apos;s start simple with Northwind:

```sql
-- Get all customers
SELECT * FROM Customers;

-- Get specific columns
SELECT CompanyName, ContactName, Country
FROM Customers;
```

### WHERE - Filtering Results

```sql
-- Customers from Germany
SELECT CompanyName, Country
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany';

-- Products that cost more than $50
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice
FROM Products
WHERE UnitPrice > 50;

-- Multiple conditions
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice, UnitsInStock
FROM Products
WHERE UnitPrice > 20 AND UnitsInStock > 0;
```

### ORDER BY - Sorting Results

```sql
-- Cheapest to most expensive
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice
FROM Products
ORDER BY UnitPrice ASC;

-- Most expensive first
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice
FROM Products
ORDER BY UnitPrice DESC;
```

## INSERT - Adding New Data

```sql
-- Add a new customer to Northwind
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, CompanyName, ContactName, Country)
VALUES ('NEWCO', 'New Company Ltd', 'John Smith', 'USA');

-- Insert multiple rows at once
INSERT INTO Products (ProductName, UnitPrice, UnitsInStock)
VALUES
    ('Widget A', 19.99, 100),
    ('Widget B', 29.99, 50),
    ('Widget C', 9.99, 200);
```

## UPDATE - Modifying Data

```sql
-- Update a single product price
UPDATE Products
SET UnitPrice = 25.00
WHERE ProductID = 1;

-- Update multiple fields
UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Maria Anders',
    Phone = '030-0074321'
WHERE CustomerID = 'ALFKI';
```

> ️ **Warning:** Always use WHERE with UPDATE! Without it, you&apos;ll change EVERY row!

## DELETE - Removing Data

```sql
-- Delete a specific order detail
DELETE FROM [Order Details]
WHERE OrderID = 10248 AND ProductID = 11;

-- Delete all discontinued products (be careful!)
DELETE FROM Products
WHERE Discontinued = 1;
```

> ️ **Warning:** DELETE without WHERE removes ALL rows!

## Key Takeaways 

1. **SELECT** reads data (most common)
2. **INSERT** adds new rows
3. **UPDATE** modifies existing rows
4. **DELETE** removes rows
5. **Always use WHERE** with UPDATE and DELETE!
