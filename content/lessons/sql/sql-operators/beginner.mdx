# SQL Operators: Making Comparisons and Calculations

Operators help you do math, compare values, and combine conditions!

##  Arithmetic Operators (Math)

Just like a calculator!

| Operator | Meaning   | Example  | Result |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ------ |
| `+`      | Add       | `5 + 3`  | 8      |
| `-`      | Subtract  | `10 - 4` | 6      |
| `*`      | Multiply  | `6 * 7`  | 42     |
| `/`      | Divide    | `20 / 4` | 5      |
| `%`      | Remainder | `17 % 5` | 2      |

```sql
SELECT
    product_name,
    price,
    price * 0.9 AS discounted_price  -- 10% off!
FROM products;
```

## ️ Comparison Operators

Compare two values:

| Operator     | Meaning          | Example               |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| `=`          | Equals           | `age = 25`            |
| `<>` or `!=` | Not equals       | `status <> 'deleted'` |
| `>`          | Greater than     | `price > 100`         |
| `<`          | Less than        | `quantity < 10`       |
| `>=`         | Greater or equal | `rating >= 4`         |
| `<=`         | Less or equal    | `stock <= 5`          |

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE price > 50;
```

##  Logical Operators

Combine conditions:

| Operator | Meaning     | When TRUE                  |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| `AND`    | Both true   | Both conditions must match |
| `OR`     | Either true | At least one matches       |
| `NOT`    | Opposite    | Condition is FALSE         |

```sql
-- AND: Must match BOTH conditions
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE price > 50 AND in_stock = TRUE;

-- OR: Match either condition
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category = 'Electronics' OR category = 'Computers';

-- NOT: Exclude matches
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE NOT category = 'Clothing';
```

##  Special Operators

| Operator  | Meaning       | Example                        |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `BETWEEN` | In a range    | `price BETWEEN 10 AND 50`      |
| `IN`      | In a list     | `status IN ('new', 'pending')` |
| `LIKE`    | Pattern match | `name LIKE 'A%'`               |
| `IS NULL` | Is missing    | `email IS NULL`                |

```sql
-- BETWEEN (includes both ends)
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 100;

-- IN (match any value in list)
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing');

-- LIKE patterns
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE 'J%';  -- Starts with J
```

##  Quick Reference

```
Math:      +  -  *  /  %
Compare:   =  <>  >  <  >=  <=
Logic:     AND  OR  NOT
Special:   BETWEEN  IN  LIKE  IS NULL
```
