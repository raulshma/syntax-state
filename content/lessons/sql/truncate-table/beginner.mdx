# TRUNCATE TABLE: Fast Data Removal

Learn the fastest way to empty a table completely!

##  What is TRUNCATE?

TRUNCATE removes **all rows** from a table instantly, while keeping the table structure intact.

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

##  Simple Example

```sql
-- Empty the logs table
TRUNCATE TABLE logs;
```

The table is now empty, but still exists!

##  TRUNCATE vs DELETE

| Feature         | TRUNCATE   | DELETE                |
| --------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Speed           | Very fast  | Slow for large tables |
| WHERE clause    | No         | Yes                   |
| Resets identity | Yes        | No                    |
| Triggers        | Don't fire | Fire                  |
| Transaction log | Minimal    | Full logging          |
| Can rollback\*  | Depends    | Yes                   |

```sql
-- DELETE: Remove some or all rows
DELETE FROM logs WHERE log_date < '2024-01-01';
DELETE FROM logs;  -- All rows, but slow

-- TRUNCATE: Remove all rows instantly
TRUNCATE TABLE logs;
```

\*In SQL Server, TRUNCATE can be rolled back within a transaction

##  When to Use TRUNCATE

 **Use TRUNCATE when:**

- Emptying temporary tables
- Clearing staging tables after ETL
- Resetting test data
- Fresh start for the table

 **Don't use TRUNCATE when:**

- You need to keep some rows (use DELETE)
- Triggers must fire
- Other tables have foreign keys to it

## ️ Foreign Key Limitation

```sql
-- This fails if other tables reference it:
TRUNCATE TABLE customers;
-- Error: Cannot truncate, referenced by FK

-- Solution: Delete instead
DELETE FROM customers;
```

##  Resets Identity Values

```sql
-- Identity starts from 1 again after TRUNCATE
CREATE TABLE items (
    id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO items (name) VALUES ('A'), ('B'), ('C');
-- IDs are 1, 2, 3

TRUNCATE TABLE items;

INSERT INTO items (name) VALUES ('D');
-- ID is 1 again (reset!)
```
