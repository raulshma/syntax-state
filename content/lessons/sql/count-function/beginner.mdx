# COUNT Function: Counting Rows

Learn to count records in your database!

##  What is COUNT?

COUNT tells you how many rows match your query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
-- Returns: Number of customers (e.g., 150)
```

##  COUNT Variations

| Syntax                   | What It Counts  |
| ------------------------ | --------------- |
| `COUNT(*)`               | All rows        |
| `COUNT(column)`          | Non-NULL values |
| `COUNT(DISTINCT column)` | Unique values   |

##  Basic Examples

```sql
-- Total orders
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders FROM orders;

-- Orders with tracking numbers
SELECT COUNT(tracking_number) AS tracked_orders FROM orders;

-- Unique customers with orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers FROM orders;
```

##  COUNT with GROUP BY

```sql
-- Orders per customer
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Products per category
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS product_count
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

##  COUNT with WHERE

```sql
-- Active customers
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE is_active = 1;

-- Orders this year
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2024;
```

##  COUNT(\*) vs COUNT(column)

```sql
-- Sample data: some emails are NULL
-- | id | email          |
-- |----|----------------|
-- | 1  | alice@test.com |
-- | 2  | NULL           |
-- | 3  | bob@test.com   |

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;      -- Returns 3 (all rows)
SELECT COUNT(email) FROM users;  -- Returns 2 (non-NULL only)
```

##  Quick Examples

```sql
-- How many products?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;

-- How many have discounts?
SELECT COUNT(discount_price) FROM products;

-- How many categories?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) FROM products;
```
