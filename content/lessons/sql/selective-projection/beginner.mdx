# Selective Projection: Choose Your Columns Wisely

Why SELECT \* can hurt performance!

##  The Problem with SELECT \*

```sql
-- SELECT * retrieves ALL columns
SELECT * FROM customers;
-- Returns: id, name, email, phone, address, city, state, zip,
--          created_at, updated_at, notes, preferences_json, ...

-- Often you only need a few:
SELECT id, name, email FROM customers;
```

##  Why Selecting Fewer Columns Helps

| Benefit                | Explanation                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Less Data Transfer** | Fewer bytes over network     |
| **Less Memory**        | Smaller result set in memory |
| **Covering Index**     | May enable index-only scan   |
| **Faster Execution**   | Less I/O from disk           |

##  Real Impact Example

```sql
-- Table: users with 20 columns, 1 million rows

-- Slow: SELECT * (reads all columns)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active';
-- Reads: ~500 MB

-- Fast: Select needed columns only
SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE status = 'active';
-- Reads: ~50 MB
```

##  Best Practice

```sql
-- BAD: Select all columns
SELECT * FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;

-- GOOD: Select only what you need
SELECT o.id, o.order_date, o.total, c.name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;
```

##  When SELECT \* is OK

- Quick exploration in development
- Ad-hoc queries in management tools
- When you need ALL columns
- When creating backup/clone tables

```sql
-- OK for backup
SELECT * INTO orders_backup FROM orders;
```
