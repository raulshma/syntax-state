# SELECT: Reading Data from Tables

The SELECT statement is your window into the database. Let's learn how to ask for data!

##  Your First Query

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

This says: "Show me **everything** from the **customers** table"

| Symbol      | Meaning            |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| `SELECT`    | I want to see...   |
| `*`         | ...all columns     |
| `FROM`      | ...from this table |
| `customers` | the table name     |

##  Choosing Specific Columns

Instead of `*` (everything), list the columns you want:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, email
FROM customers;
```

**Result:**
| first_name | last_name | email |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| Alice | Smith | alice@email.com |
| Bob | Jones | bob@email.com |

##  Renaming Columns with AS

Make your results clearer with aliases:

```sql
SELECT
    first_name AS "First Name",
    last_name AS "Last Name",
    email AS "Email Address"
FROM customers;
```

##  Calculated Columns

Do math in your query!

```sql
SELECT
    product_name,
    price,
    price * 0.9 AS sale_price  -- 10% discount
FROM products;
```

**Result:**
| product_name | price | sale_price |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| Widget | 100.00 | 90.00 |
| Gadget | 50.00 | 45.00 |

##  Quick Tips

1. **Always name your columns** - easier to read than \*
2. **Use AS for clarity** - rename confusing columns
3. **Order matters** - columns appear in the order you list them

```sql
-- Shows: name first, then price
SELECT product_name, price FROM products;

-- Shows: price first, then name
SELECT price, product_name FROM products;
```

##  DISTINCT - Removing Duplicates

See only unique values:

```sql
-- Shows all cities (might repeat)
SELECT city FROM customers;

-- Shows each city only once
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM customers;
```
