# GRANT and REVOKE: Database Permissions

Control who can do what in your database!

##  What is GRANT?

GRANT gives permissions to users:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON products TO john;
-- John can now read from products table
```

##  What is REVOKE?

REVOKE removes permissions:

```sql
REVOKE SELECT ON products FROM john;
-- John can no longer read products
```

##  Common Permissions

| Permission | Allows         |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| SELECT     | Read data      |
| INSERT     | Add rows       |
| UPDATE     | Modify rows    |
| DELETE     | Remove rows    |
| EXECUTE    | Run procedures |
| ALL        | Everything     |

##  Basic Examples

```sql
-- Grant single permission
GRANT SELECT ON customers TO analyst_user;

-- Grant multiple permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON orders TO app_user;

-- Grant all permissions
GRANT ALL ON products TO admin_user;

-- Grant on all tables
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly_user;
```

##  Granting to Roles

```sql
-- Create a role
CREATE ROLE sales_team;

-- Grant to role
GRANT SELECT ON orders TO sales_team;
GRANT SELECT ON customers TO sales_team;

-- Add users to role
GRANT sales_team TO john;
