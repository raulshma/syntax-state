# Creating Views: Virtual Tables

Create reusable queries as virtual tables!

## ️ What is a View?

A view is a saved query that acts like a table:

```sql
CREATE VIEW active_customers AS
SELECT id, name, email
FROM customers
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Use like a table
SELECT * FROM active_customers;
```

##  Basic Syntax

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

##  Why Use Views?

1. **Simplify complex queries** - Write once, use many times
2. **Security** - Hide columns users shouldn't see
3. **Abstraction** - Change underlying structure without affecting users
4. **Consistency** - Same query logic everywhere

##  Examples

```sql
-- Simplify JOINs
CREATE VIEW order_details AS
SELECT
    o.id AS order_id,
    c.name AS customer_name,
    o.total,
    o.order_date
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;

-- Now just:
SELECT * FROM order_details WHERE order_date > '2024-01-01';
```

```sql
-- Hide sensitive data
CREATE VIEW public_employees AS
SELECT id, name, department, title
FROM employees;  -- Hides salary, SSN, etc.
```

##  Views Are Dynamic!

Views show current data, not a snapshot:

```sql
CREATE VIEW recent_orders AS
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > DATEADD(DAY, -7, GETDATE());

-- Always shows last 7 days from NOW
SELECT * FROM recent_orders;
```
