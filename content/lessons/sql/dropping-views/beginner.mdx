# Dropping Views: Removing Virtual Tables

Safely remove views from your database!

## ️ Basic DROP VIEW

```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;

-- Example
DROP VIEW active_customers;
```

##  DROP IF EXISTS

Avoid errors if view doesn't exist:

```sql
-- SQL Server
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS my_view;

-- PostgreSQL / MySQL
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS my_view;

-- Older SQL Server
IF OBJECT_ID('my_view', 'V') IS NOT NULL
    DROP VIEW my_view;
```

##  When to Drop Views

1. **No longer needed** - Feature removed
2. **Replaced** - New version created
3. **Obsolete** - Underlying tables changed
4. **Cleanup** - Development/test views

## ️ What Happens When You Drop

```sql
-- Only the view is dropped
-- Underlying tables are NOT affected

DROP VIEW customer_summary;
-- The customers table still exists!
```

##  Check Before Dropping

```sql
-- See what depends on this view
-- SQL Server
SELECT
    OBJECT_NAME(d.referencing_id) AS dependent_object
FROM sys.sql_expression_dependencies d
WHERE d.referenced_entity_name = 'my_view';

-- If anything depends on it, dropping will cause errors!
```

##  Drop Multiple Views

```sql
DROP VIEW view1, view2, view3;
```

##  Best Practice

```sql
-- Always use IF EXISTS to prevent errors
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS old_view;

-- Script views before dropping (for backup)
-- In SSMS: Right-click → Script View as → CREATE To
```
