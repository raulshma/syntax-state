# DELETE: Removing Data Safely

Learn how to remove records from your database - with caution!

## ️ Basic DELETE Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

> ️ **Always use WHERE!** Without it, you'll delete ALL rows!

##  Your First DELETE

```sql
-- Delete one customer by ID
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE id = 1;
```

##  Deleting Multiple Rows

```sql
-- Delete all inactive customers
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE status = 'inactive';

-- Delete old orders
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE order_date < '2020-01-01';
```

## ️ The Danger Zone

```sql
-- DANGEROUS: Deletes ALL data!
DELETE FROM customers;
-- Your entire customer table is now empty! 😱

-- Also deletes ALL data:
DELETE FROM customers WHERE 1=1;
```

##  Safe DELETE Workflow

1. **SELECT first** to see what you're about to delete:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'cancelled';
```

2. **Check the count**:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'cancelled';
-- 47 rows - is this what you expect?
```

3. **Convert to DELETE**:

```sql
DELETE FROM orders WHERE status = 'cancelled';
```

4. **Verify**:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'cancelled';
-- Should be 0
```

##  DELETE vs TRUNCATE

|           | DELETE               | TRUNCATE      |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| Speed     | Slower               | Very Fast     |
| WHERE?    | Yes                  | No (all rows) |
| Undo?     | Yes (in transaction) | Usually no    |
| Triggers? | Fire                 | Don't fire    |
| Reset ID? | No                   | Yes           |

```sql
-- TRUNCATE: Fast way to empty entire table
TRUNCATE TABLE temp_logs;
```

##  Common Patterns

```sql
-- Delete by ID
DELETE FROM products WHERE id = 123;

-- Delete by date
DELETE FROM logs WHERE created_at < DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE());

-- Delete by status
DELETE FROM orders WHERE status = 'draft' AND customer_id IS NULL;
```
