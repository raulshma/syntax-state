# SUM Function: Adding Up Values

Learn to calculate totals in your database!

##  What is SUM?

SUM adds up all values in a column:

```sql
SELECT SUM(price) FROM products;
-- Returns: Total of all product prices
```

##  Basic Examples

```sql
-- Total revenue from all orders
SELECT SUM(total) AS total_revenue FROM orders;

-- Total quantity in inventory
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_items FROM inventory;

-- Total salaries
SELECT SUM(salary) AS payroll FROM employees;
```

##  SUM with GROUP BY

Calculate totals for each group:

```sql
-- Revenue per customer
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total) AS customer_total
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Inventory per category
SELECT category, SUM(quantity) AS category_stock
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

##  SUM with Conditions

```sql
-- Total of only high-value orders
SELECT SUM(total) AS high_value_total
FROM orders
WHERE total > 100;

-- Total per status
SELECT status, SUM(total) AS status_total
FROM orders
GROUP BY status;
```

##  NULL Handling

SUM ignores NULL values:

```sql
-- If values are: 10, 20, NULL, 30
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM payments;
-- Returns: 60 (NULL is ignored)
```

##  SUM with Expressions

```sql
-- Calculate extended totals
SELECT SUM(quantity * price) AS grand_total
FROM order_items;

-- Sum with discount applied
SELECT SUM(price * (1 - discount)) AS discounted_total
FROM products;
```
