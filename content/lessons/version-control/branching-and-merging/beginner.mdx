# Branching and Merging

<InfoBox type="tip">
A branch is like a **parallel timeline**. You can experiment without breaking the main story.
</InfoBox>

## Branches are lightweight pointers

In Git, branches are not big copies of files. They’re mostly **names that point to commits**.

## Create a branch and switch to it

Create and switch in one command:

```bash
git switch -c feature/login
```

List branches:

```bash
git branch
```

Switch back:

```bash
git switch main
```

## Merge your work back to main

Typical flow:

```bash
git switch main

git merge feature/login
```

If Git can do it cleanly, you’re done.

## Merge conflicts (what they are)

A conflict happens when Git can’t automatically combine changes.

Usually this means:

- you and someone else edited the same lines
- or two branches changed the same part of a file differently

When you see a conflict:

1) Open the file
2) Choose which version (or combine them)
3) Stage the resolved file
4) Commit the merge

<InfoBox type="tip">
Conflicts are normal. They’re Git asking you to make a decision.

## Merge vs rebase (beginner-friendly rule)

For now:

- use **merge** to combine branches
- avoid **rebase** until you’re comfortable (it can rewrite history)

## Summary

<KeyConcept title="Branching loop">
1) `git switch -c feature/x`
2) commit work on the branch
3) `git switch main`
4) `git merge feature/x`
5) resolve conflicts if needed
