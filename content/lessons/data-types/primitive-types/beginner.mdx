# The Building Blocks of Data

Imagine you're building with LEGO bricks. Before you can create a castle or a spaceship, you need to understand the basic pieces - the simple bricks that everything else is made from.

In JavaScript, **primitive types** are like those basic LEGO bricks. They're the simplest, most fundamental pieces of data that everything else is built upon.

## What is a Type?

Think of a grocery store. Everything is organized into categories:

- 🍎 Fruits go in one section
- 🥛 Dairy in another
- 🍞 Bread somewhere else

**Types** in programming work the same way - they tell JavaScript what _kind_ of data we're working with.

## The 7 Primitive Types

JavaScript has exactly **7 primitive types**. Let's meet each one:

| Type          | What It Stores             | Example           |
| :------------ | :------------------------- | :---------------- |
| **string**    | Text (words, sentences)    | "Hello, World!"   |
| **number**    | Numbers (whole or decimal) | 42, 3.14          |
| **boolean**   | True or false              | true, false       |
| **null**      | "Nothing" (on purpose)     | null              |
| **undefined** | "Not set yet"              | undefined         |
| **symbol**    | Unique identifier          | Symbol("id")      |
| **bigint**    | Really huge numbers        | 9999999999999999n |

## Understanding Each Type

### Strings - Text Values 📝

Anything in quotes is a **string**. It's just text!

```javascript
let name = "Alice";
let greeting = "Hello!";
let message = `Welcome, ${name}!`;
```

> **Think of it like:** A sticky note with words written on it.

### Numbers - Numeric Values 🔢

All numbers in JavaScript are the **number** type - whether they're whole numbers or decimals.

```javascript
let age = 25;
let price = 19.99;
let temperature = -5;
```

> **Think of it like:** A calculator display showing a value.

### Booleans - True or False 💡

Booleans are like light switches - they can only be **on** (true) or **off** (false).

```javascript
let isLoggedIn = true;
let hasPermission = false;
```

> **Think of it like:** A yes/no question. There's no "maybe"!

### Null & Undefined - Empty Values ❓📦

These two represent "nothing," but in different ways:

- **undefined** = "I haven't been given a value yet"
- **null** = "I was intentionally set to empty"

```javascript
let notSet; // This is undefined
let empty = null; // This is null (on purpose)
```

> **Think of it like:**
>
> - **undefined** is an empty box that was never filled
> - **null** is a box you deliberately emptied
