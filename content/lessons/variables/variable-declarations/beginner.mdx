# Variable Declarations: var, let, and const

Welcome to the world of JavaScript variables! Think of variables as **labeled storage boxes** where you can keep things. Let's explore the three types of boxes JavaScript gives us.

## The Three Magic Boxes

Imagine you have three types of storage boxes:

| Box Type  | Real-World Analogy            | What It Does                             |
| :-------- | :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **var**   | A magic box that can teleport | Old-school, can move around unexpectedly |
| **let**   | A regular box with a lid      | Modern, stays where you put it           |
| **const** | A locked safe                 | Cannot change what's inside              |

## The `var` Keyword - The Old Way

`var` is like a **magic box that can teleport** to the top of your code. It was the original way to create variables in JavaScript.

```javascript
var greeting = "Hello!";
var age = 25;
var isHappy = true;
```

> **Think of it like this:** When you use `var`, JavaScript takes your box and moves it to the very top of the room (this is called "hoisting"). This can sometimes cause confusion!

<CodePlayground 
  code={`// Even though we use greeting before declaring it,
// var hoists it to the top!
console.log(greeting); // undefined, not an error!

var greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting); // "Hello, World!"`}
title="var Example"
/>

## The `let` Keyword - The Modern Choice

`let` is like a **regular storage box** that stays exactly where you put it. It was introduced in 2015 to fix the confusing parts of `var`.

```javascript
let name = "Alice";
let score = 100;
let isPlaying = false;
```

> **The key difference:** If you try to use a `let` variable before declaring it, JavaScript will give you an error. This is actually helpful because it catches mistakes!

<CodePlayground 
  code={`// This will cause an error!
// console.log(name); // ReferenceError!

let name = "Bob";
console.log(name); // "Bob"

// You CAN change what's inside
name = "Charlie";
console.log(name); // "Charlie"`}
title="let Example"
/>

## The `const` Keyword - The Locked Safe

`const` is like a **locked safe** - once you put something in, the label stays attached to that thing forever!

```javascript
const PI = 3.14159;
const APP_NAME = "My Cool App";
const MAX_USERS = 100;
```

> **Important:** With `const`, you cannot reassign the variable to a different value. But if the value is an object or array, you CAN still change properties inside it!

<CodePlayground 
  code={`const myName = "Diana";
// myName = "Eve"; // ERROR! Cannot reassign!

// But objects can have properties changed:
const person = { name: "Frank" };
person.name = "Grace"; // This works!
console.log(person.name); // "Grace"`}
title="const Example"
/>

| Feature       |  var   |      let       |          const          |
| :------------ | :----: | :------------: | :---------------------: |
| Can reassign? |  Yes   |      Yes       |           No            |
| Block scoped? |   No   |      Yes       |           Yes           |
| Hoisted?      |  Yes   |      No\*      |          No\*           |
| When to use?  | Rarely | Default choice | When value won't change |

> **Pro Tip:** In modern JavaScript, use `const` by default. Only use `let` when you need to reassign. Avoid `var` unless you're working with old code!
