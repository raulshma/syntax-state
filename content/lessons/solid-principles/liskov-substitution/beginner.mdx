# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

If it looks like a duck 🦆 and quacks like a duck 🔊, but needs batteries 🔋... you probably have the wrong abstraction!

**The Liskov Substitution Principle is about keeping promises.**

## Section 1: The Duck Test 🦆

Imagine you have a pond full of ducks. One day, you add what looks like a duck:

| **Real Duck** 🦆 | **Mechanical Duck** 🤖 |
|:-----------------|:----------------------|
| Quacks | Quacks (with batteries) |
| Swims | Floats (doesn't work in rain) |
| Flies | Crashes into trees |
| Eats bread | Jams up with bread |

The mechanical duck **looks** like a duck, but it **doesn't behave** like one. If you expected a real duck and got a mechanical one, things would break!

**The LSP Says:** If class B extends class A, then you should be able to use B anywhere you use A **without surprises**.

### The Classic Example: Birds 🐦

## Section 2: Why Is This a Problem?

Imagine you're building a bird game:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Expect["fa:fa-check Your Code Expects"]
        E["For each bird:<br />bird.Fly()"]
    end
    
    Expect -->|"Works for eagles, sparrows..."| OK["fa:fa-dove Flying birds work!"]
    Expect -->|"But then..."| CRASH["fa:fa-bomb CRASH!<br />Penguin throws exception!"]
```

Your code expected all birds to fly. The penguin broke that promise!

### Real-World Analogies

| Expectation | Reality | Problem |
|:------------|:--------|:--------|
| 🚗 "All vehicles have wheels" | Boat is a vehicle | Boat breaks the promise |
| 📦 "All boxes can be stacked" | Fragile box | Crushing = broken promise |
| 🔌 "All chargers fit my phone" | Wrong connector | Can't charge = broken promise |

## Section 3: The Simple Rule

> **"Derived classes must be able to substitute for their base classes."**
> — Barbara Liskov (1987)

Ask yourself:
- If I replace the parent class with a child class, will everything still work?
- Does my child class **keep all the promises** made by the parent?

### Good vs Bad Inheritance

| **❌ Bad** (Breaks LSP) | **✅ Good** (Follows LSP) |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Penguin extends Bird (with Fly method) | FlyingBird vs SwimmingBird |
| Square extends Rectangle | Shape interface |
| Stack extends ArrayList | Stack uses ArrayList |

### Key Takeaways

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Remember">
- 🦆 **Duck test** - If it looks like a duck, it should ACT like a duck
- 🤝 **Keep promises** - Child classes must honor parent class behavior
- 🔄 **Substitutability** - You can swap parent for child without problems
- 🚫 **No surprises** - Don't throw exceptions where parent doesn't
