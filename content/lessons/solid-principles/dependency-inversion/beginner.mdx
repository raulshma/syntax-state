# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Imagine buying a new lamp. Would you prefer to:

A) Wire it directly into your house's electrical system? 🔌⚡
B) Just plug it into a wall outlet? 🔌✨

Obviously B! That's the **Dependency Inversion Principle** in action.

## Section 1: The Wall Outlet Analogy 🔌

| **Direct Wiring** ⚡ | **Using an Outlet** 🔌 |
|:---------------------|:----------------------|
| Need an electrician | Anyone can do it |
| Permanent connection | Easy to unplug |
| One lamp per wire | Any device with a plug |
| Changing lamps = rewiring | Just swap devices |

Wall outlets are **standardized interfaces**. Any device with a standard plug can use any outlet. Your lamp doesn't care if the power comes from a coal plant or solar panels!

<InfoBox type="tip">
**The DIP Says:** Don't connect your code directly to specific implementations. Use "outlets" (interfaces) so you can easily swap things out!

## Section 2: The Problem - Tight Coupling

When your code directly creates and uses specific classes, it's "hardwired":

### Direct Connection = Problems

```mermaid

    OS["fa:fa-times OrderService<br/>(High-Level)"]
    OS -->|Directly creates| SQL["fa:fa-database SqlDatabase<br/>(Low-Level)"]
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Can't test OrderService without a real database!
- ❌ Want to use MongoDB? Rewrite OrderService!
- ❌ OrderService "knows too much" about database details

## Section 3: The Solution - Program to an Interface

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    OS["fa:fa-check OrderService (High-Level)<br/>depends on: IDatabase"]
    OS --> IDB["fa:fa-plug IDatabase (Interface)<br/>The Wall Outlet"]
    IDB --> SQL["fa:fa-database SQL Database"]
    IDB --> MDB["fa:fa-database MongoDB Database"]
```
     
Now you can swap databases without touching OrderService!

### The Simple Rule

> **"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."**
> — Robert C. Martin

### Key Takeaways

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Remember">
- 🔌 **Use "outlets" (interfaces)** - Don't hardwire your code
- 📦 **Depend on abstractions** - Not specific implementations
- 🔄 **Swappable parts** - Like changing a tire without redesigning the car
- 🧪 **Enables testing** - Use fake implementations in tests
