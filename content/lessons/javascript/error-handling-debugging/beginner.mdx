# Error Handling and Debugging

Welcome to one of the most practical skills in programming! Errors happen to everyone — even the best developers. The key is knowing how to handle them gracefully and find the bugs in your code. Let's learn how!

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Why This Matters">
Every program will encounter errors at some point. Learning to handle errors properly means your apps won't crash unexpectedly, and you'll be able to fix bugs much faster!
</InfoBox>

## What Are Errors?

Think of errors like warning lights on a car dashboard. They tell you something went wrong and often give you a hint about what the problem is.

In JavaScript, when something goes wrong, the program "throws" an error. If you don't "catch" it, your program stops running!

```javascript
// This will cause an error and stop your program
const user = null;
console.log(user.name);  // 💥 TypeError!
// Nothing after this line runs...
```

<KeyConcept title="Errors vs Bugs">
- **Error**: Something unexpected happened (like trying to read a file that doesn't exist)
- **Bug**: A mistake in your code logic (like adding instead of subtracting)

Both need to be handled, but in different ways!
</KeyConcept>

<ProgressCheckpoint section="error-types" xpReward={15} />

## Common Error Types

JavaScript has several built-in error types. Each one tells you something different about what went wrong:

<ErrorTypeExplorer initialErrorType="type-error" />

The most common errors you'll see are:

1. **TypeError** - You tried to use something the wrong way (like calling `.map()` on `null`)
2. **ReferenceError** - You used a variable that doesn't exist
3. **SyntaxError** - Your code has a typo or missing bracket

<InfoBox type="info" title="Reading Error Messages">
Error messages might look scary, but they're actually helpful! They tell you:
- **What** went wrong (the error type)
- **Where** it happened (file and line number)
- **Why** it happened (the error message)
</InfoBox>

<ProgressCheckpoint section="try-catch" xpReward={15} />

## Try/Catch: Your Safety Net

The `try/catch` statement is like a safety net for your code. You "try" to run some code, and if it fails, you "catch" the error instead of crashing.

```javascript
try {
  // Code that might fail goes here
  const user = null;
  console.log(user.name);  // This will throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // This runs if an error occurs
  console.log("Oops! Something went wrong:", error.message);
}

// Your program keeps running! 🎉
console.log("Program continues...");
```

<KeyConcept title="Try/Catch Structure">
```javascript
try {
  // Risky code here
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error here
} finally {
  // This ALWAYS runs (optional)
}
```
</KeyConcept>

Try it yourself:

<CodePlayground
  initialCode={`// Try/Catch example
function getUserName(user) {
  try {
    // This might fail if user is null
    return user.name;
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error caught:", error.message);
    return "Unknown User";
  }
}

// Test with a valid user
const validUser = { name: "Alice" };
console.log("Valid:", getUserName(validUser));

// Test with null (would normally crash!)
const invalidUser = null;
console.log("Invalid:", getUserName(invalidUser));

console.log(" Program didn't crash!");`}
/>

## Console Methods: Your Debugging Friends

The `console` object has several methods to help you understand what's happening in your code:

```javascript
// Basic logging
console.log("Hello!");           // General output

// Different log levels
console.info("FYI: User logged in");    // Information
console.warn("Warning: Low memory");     // Warnings (yellow)
console.error("Error: Connection lost"); // Errors (red)

// Inspect objects
const user = { name: "Bob", age: 25 };
console.log(user);              // Shows the object
console.table(user);            // Shows as a table!

// Track time
console.time("myTimer");
// ... some code ...
console.timeEnd("myTimer");     // Shows how long it took
```

<CodePlayground
  initialCode={`// Console methods demo
console.log(" Regular log message");
console.info("ℹ️ Info message");
console.warn("️ Warning message");
console.error(" Error message");

// Logging objects
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  hobbies: ["reading", "coding"]
};

console.log("Person object:", person);

// Timing code
console.time("Loop time");
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  sum += i;
}
console.timeEnd("Loop time");
console.log("Sum:", sum);`}
/>

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Pro Tip: console.log() Everything!">
When you're confused about what's happening, add `console.log()` statements to see the values of variables at different points. It's the simplest debugging technique!

## Reading Stack Traces

When an error occurs, JavaScript shows you a "stack trace" — a list of all the functions that were running when the error happened.

<StackTraceAnalyzer />

Think of it like a trail of breadcrumbs:
- The **top** of the stack is where the error happened
- Each line below shows what called that function
- Follow the trail to understand how you got there!

```javascript
// Example that creates a stack trace
function third() {
  throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
}

function second() {
  third();  // Calls third
}

function first() {
  second();  // Calls second
}

first();  // Calls first
// Stack trace shows: third → second → first
```

## Key Takeaways

<KeyConcept title="Try/Catch">
Wrap risky code in `try/catch` to prevent crashes. The `catch` block receives the error object with details about what went wrong.
</KeyConcept>

<KeyConcept title="Error Types">
Different error types (TypeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError) tell you what kind of problem occurred. Read the error message carefully!
</KeyConcept>

<KeyConcept title="Console Methods">
Use `console.log()`, `console.warn()`, and `console.error()` to output information while debugging. `console.table()` is great for objects!
</KeyConcept>

<KeyConcept title="Stack Traces">
Read stack traces from top to bottom. The top shows where the error occurred, and each line below shows what called it.
</KeyConcept>
