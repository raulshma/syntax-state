# JavaScript Syntax and Basic Constructs

Welcome to JavaScript! JavaScript is the programming language that makes websites interactive and dynamic. Don't worry if you're new to programming — we'll start from the very beginning and build up your knowledge step by step.

Think of JavaScript as a way to give **instructions** to your computer. Just like following a recipe to bake a cake, you write a series of steps that the computer follows to create something amazing!

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Why Learn JavaScript?">
JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It runs in every web browser and can be used to build websites, mobile apps, games, and even server applications!

## Variables: Labeled Boxes for Your Data

Imagine you have a bunch of labeled boxes in your room. Each box has a name written on it, and you can put things inside. That's exactly what **variables** are in JavaScript!

A variable is like a labeled container that holds information. You can:
- **Create** a box and give it a name
- **Put something** inside the box
- **Look at** what's in the box
- **Change** what's in the box (sometimes)

### Creating Variables

In JavaScript, we have three ways to create variables:

```javascript
let name = "Alice";      // Can be changed later
const age = 25;          // Cannot be changed (constant)
var score = 100;         // Old way (avoid using this)
```

<KeyConcept title="let vs const vs var">
- Use **let** when the value might change
- Use **const** when the value should never change
- Avoid **var** — it's the old way and can cause confusion
</KeyConcept>

### Try It Yourself!

<CodePlayground
  initialCode={`// Create some variables
let greeting = "Hello!";
const year = 2024;
let isLearning = true;

// Print them to see their values
console.log(greeting);
console.log("The year is:", year);
console.log("Am I learning?", isLearning);

// Try changing a variable
greeting = "Hi there!";
console.log("New greeting:", greeting);`}
/>

## Data Types: What Can Go in the Boxes?

Just like real boxes can hold different things (toys, books, clothes), JavaScript variables can hold different **types** of data:

### 1. Strings (Text)
Text is wrapped in quotes. Think of it as a "string" of characters.

```javascript
let name = "Alice";
let message = 'Hello, World!';
let template = `My name is ${name}`;  // Template literal
```

### 2. Numbers
Numbers don't need quotes. They can be whole numbers or decimals.

```javascript
let age = 25;
let price = 19.99;
let negative = -10;
```

### 3. Booleans (True/False)
Like a light switch — it's either on or off.

```javascript
let isStudent = true;
let hasGraduated = false;
```

### 4. Undefined and Null
Special values for "nothing" or "empty".

```javascript
let notYetSet;           // undefined (no value assigned)
let emptyOnPurpose = null;  // null (intentionally empty)
```

<InfoBox type="info" title="Checking Types">
You can use `typeof` to find out what type a value is:
```javascript
console.log(typeof "hello");  // "string"
console.log(typeof 42);       // "number"
console.log(typeof true);     // "boolean"
```
</InfoBox>

<CodePlayground
  initialCode={`// Explore different data types
let myName = "JavaScript Learner";
let myAge = 20;
let isAwesome = true;
let mystery;

console.log("Name:", myName, "- Type:", typeof myName);
console.log("Age:", myAge, "- Type:", typeof myAge);
console.log("Awesome?:", isAwesome, "- Type:", typeof isAwesome);
console.log("Mystery:", mystery, "- Type:", typeof mystery);`}
/>

## Operators: Doing Math and More

Operators let you perform actions on your data. Think of them as tools in your toolbox!

### Math Operators

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 3;

console.log(a + b);   // 13 (addition)
console.log(a - b);   // 7 (subtraction)
console.log(a * b);   // 30 (multiplication)
console.log(a / b);   // 3.333... (division)
console.log(a % b);   // 1 (remainder/modulo)
```

### Comparison Operators

These compare values and return `true` or `false`:

```javascript
console.log(5 > 3);    // true (greater than)
console.log(5 < 3);    // false (less than)
console.log(5 === 5);  // true (equal to)
console.log(5 !== 3);  // true (not equal to)
```

<KeyConcept title="=== vs ==">
Always use `===` (triple equals) for comparison! It checks both value AND type. The double equals `==` can give unexpected results.
</KeyConcept>

<CodePlayground
  initialCode={`// Play with operators
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

console.log("Addition:", x + y);
console.log("Subtraction:", x - y);
console.log("Multiplication:", x * y);
console.log("Division:", x / y);

console.log("Is x greater than y?", x > y);
console.log("Is x equal to 10?", x === 10);
console.log("Is y not equal to 5?", y !== 5);`}
/>

## Control Flow: Making Decisions

Programs need to make decisions. "If this happens, do that. Otherwise, do something else." This is called **control flow**.

### If Statements

Think of it like a fork in the road:

```javascript
let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You can vote!");
} else {
  console.log("You're too young to vote.");
}
```

### Multiple Conditions

```javascript
let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (score >= 70) {
  console.log("Grade: C");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: F");
}
```

<CodePlayground
  initialCode={`// Make decisions with if statements
let temperature = 25;

if (temperature > 30) {
  console.log("It's hot! ");
} else if (temperature > 20) {
  console.log("It's nice weather! ️");
} else if (temperature > 10) {
  console.log("It's cool. 🧥");
} else {
  console.log("It's cold! ️");
}

// Try changing the temperature and run again!`}
/>

## Functions: Reusable Recipes

A **function** is like a recipe. You write the instructions once, give it a name, and then you can use it whenever you need it!

### Creating a Function

```javascript
// Define the function (write the recipe)
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

// Call the function (follow the recipe)
greet("Alice");  // Output: Hello, Alice!
greet("Bob");    // Output: Hello, Bob!
```

### Functions with Return Values

Functions can also give back a result:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let result = add(5, 3);
console.log(result);  // 8
```

<KeyConcept title="Parameters vs Arguments">
- **Parameters** are the placeholders in the function definition (like `name` in `function greet(name)`)
- **Arguments** are the actual values you pass when calling the function (like `"Alice"` in `greet("Alice")`)
</KeyConcept>

<CodePlayground
  initialCode={`// Create and use functions
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

function calculateArea(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}

// Call the functions
sayHello("JavaScript Learner");

let area = calculateArea(5, 3);
console.log("Area:", area);

// Try creating your own function!`}
/>
